The team behind 0x strongly believes that in the future, you will find thousands of tokens from Ethereum and that 0x can provide an efficient and trustworthy way to exchange them.\r\n\r\n0x have several benefits such as it can be any asset. The 0x protocol facilitates the exchange of a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum-based tokens</a> including currencies, game items, and many more digital assets. Besides, it has a networked liquidity. By sharing a standard API, relayers can easily aggregate liquidity pools, creating network effects around liquidity that compound as more relayers come online. 0x also can be exchanged anywhere. 0x allows trade functionality to fade into the background, enabling developers to focus on building while 0x handles the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe co-founders of 0x are Will Warren and Amir Bandeali, the first of which is the CEO and the second of which is the CTO. Both are in smart contract research and development. Warren used to conduct applied physics research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory after studying mechanical engineering at UC San Diego. Bandeali used to be a fixed income trader with DRW after he studied finance at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. \r\n\r\n0x doesn’t charge fees of any type to use their protocol; it is free. However, if someone chooses to create a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange using the protocol, that person, known as a Relayer, can charge fees.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\n0x protocol works where : A “Creator” sends his request and at that same point the request is posted in an off-chain arrange/order book by the “Relayer”, next to which the request is acknowledged by the “Taker” by pushing the exchange into the task’s DEX smart contract. Thus, the 0x protocol uses off-chain order books, which is maintained by a relayer for settlement of trade between two parties. Relayers, being behind the maintenance and creation of these channels are incentivised by charging and collecting fees.\r\n\r\n0x (ZRX) Token:\r\n\r\nZRX token is the unique aspect of 0x project which will be used to pay ‘relayers the trading fees by the users of the protocol. It is also a governance token in a decentralized form for the 0x protocol’s upgrade.

ABLE’s P2P loan matching engine and DEX based mutual fund platform solve current tradition banking and investing problem. Blockchain technology enable to connect global investors and entrepreneurs regardless of border in a reliable way.\r\n\r\nThe ABLE project has been proposed to provide an alternative to banks’ conventional lendingdeposit spread structure, and to solve problems with initial cryptocurrency banking services.\r\n\r\nBy developing a matching engine that connects investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer basis, the project directly connects investors and borrowers without any intermediaries. With intermediaries and lending spreads eliminated, cryptocurrency interest rates will be determined by mutual agreement between users in a free market, and said rates will serve as market interest rates. Investors can receive higher interests than they would in a centralized market, while borrowers can lend money at lower rates, creating a win-win scenario. Since investing and lending occur governed by smart contracts, the project will eliminate exposure to managers’ moral hazard and the risk of central-server hacking.\r\n\r\nCurrent cryptocurrency banking services provide deposits and loans separately rather than linking depositors and borrowers. The services have shortcomings such as inability to provide high deposit interest rates in a sustainable way. Such services cannot mitigate or eliminate intermediary risks because their structure is based on a centralized model. On the other hand, the ABLE project directly links users, primarily through an account, and enables a variety of financial activities such as payroll and investment, based on smart contracts. \r\n\r\nThe ABLE project primarily aims to apply decentralized blockchain technology to financial and wealth management features; to directly link demand and supply through an account on a peer-to-peer basis; and to establish a reliable system.

Organizing data is simply not enough, it needs to be stored in such a way that it can easily be accessed and retrieved.\r\n\r\nSecurity/Privacy\r\nNever worry about compromising your security when it comes to putting large amounts of data on the blockchain. Place immutable, permanent FS links into a blockchain transaction which will enable users to timestamp and secure data without having to risk putting the data itself on the chain.\r\n\r\nSwift Transactions\r\nInstant Transactions: SwiftTX transactions are confirmed and spendable within seconds, guaranteed by the network of masternodes, with no need to wait for over-bearing amounts of confirmations in order to be confident in the validity of the transaction.\r\n\r\nData Distribution\r\nIf you or your company delivers large amounts of data to users, a peer to peer approach could save you a fortune on bandwidth alone. Through P2P content/data delivery, users can lower their running costs and increase their operational efficiency drastically.

Now these protocols are only laid in existing cryptocurrencies, but in ATB Coin they will be basic, since partial implementation of the above-described blockchain upgrades will be implemented already from the start.\r\nThis gives ATB Coin a number of useful features, one of them is an unlimited number of transactions processed absolutely free of charge in the so-called payment channel. The Lightning Network protocol also allows you to calculate the network commission only when the channel is closed (for example, at the end of the day or month). This fundamental feature is difficult to overestimate, as it increases the efficiency of bandwidth blockchain.\r\nAnother available advanced feature is ATB-Code, which is the ability to cold store and transfer coins via code.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the ‘official’ cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network’s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Grøstl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">BTC</a> blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.","twitter_screen_name":"AuroraOffic_en","facebook_username":"AuroraOfficialEN","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"4437272","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4755/small/aurora-logo.png?1547040076","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"28.535","developer_score":"0","community_score":"11.556","liquidity_score":"38.482","public_interest_score":"35.944","total_supply":"10000000000","circulating_supply":"4345218905","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

You can connect directly with peers and transact without the need for a middleman like Amazon, eBay, or Craigslist. Transactions are secure and anonymous. They’re also guaranteed by escrow. The project aims to be the new standard for eCommerce, allowing individuals to trade one-to-one at scale. As a result, BitBay claims it will revolutionize global trade. It’s seemingly a great solution for other niche applications as well, where groups of people aren’t served by existing marketplaces. In the beginning, BitBay got off to a rocky start. In 2014, the original founders raised capital in bad faith and quickly abandoned the project after fundraising, leaving the lead developer holding the bag. It seemed like BitBay was finished, but the developer continued working on the project out of a sense of duty to the original investors, without access to the capital raised in the fundraising round.\r\n\r\nThe BAY token is the transactional token in the marketplace. You use it to buy and sell, and it can also participate in freezes, escrow, bets, swaps, etc. The token itself operates like Bitcoin and is secured by the network. Although you can use BAY for transactions, you don’t have to. You do, however, have to use BAY if you’d like to take part in token staking. BAY’s price cratered after the original founders left and stayed low until March 2017 when it took off. It has been through several cycles of bull and bear runs, with a max price over 30 cents in January 2018 before retreating to its current value.\r\n\r\nBitBay supports all kinds of privacy and security measures. It’s easy to create a multisignature wallet for added security. There are integrations for Tor and other proxies that help anonymize your connection to the marketplace. An on-screen keyboard allows for password or key entry without using your keyboard and being susceptible to keylogging. Additionally, you can create images with your private key embedded, so that finding a stored key is more difficult for a hacker. The marketplace also has functionality for time locking contracts and swapping currencies. This enables all kinds of cross-chain transactions and financial implements. The time lock and other smart contract elements make it possible to create bets, escrow, futures and options trades, or any number of other financial transactions.\r\n\r\nThe idea and implementation by BitBay, of a decentralized marketplace and trading platform is brilliant and shows further promise of expansion.The rocky beginning of the cryptocurrency and its subsequent comeback as a promising platform indicate that the developers are in it for the long haul and don’t plan on abandoning the platform after all these years.

With BHD, mining is simple and accessible.\r\n \t\r\nPOW-based mining is all about raw computing power and energy output, whereas BHD's POC-based mining is far more energy efficient and returns to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original ideal that mining would be decentralized and performed by ordinary people.\r\n \t\r\nPOC (Proof of Capacity) scans are only performed once every few minutes. For the rest of the time the hard disk is on stand-by with negligible power usage, greatly reducing energy costs.\r\n \t\r\nBased on capacity proof, it will support super-large blocks in the future and will add functions such as \r\nzero-knowledge proof.\r\n \t\r\nSolid-state drives are expensive, POC has no requirement for fast data processing, only capacity, so POC naturally \r\neliminates ASIC chips.\r\n \t\r\nCurrently, the amount of energy expended globally in POW mining is greater than the total energy output of 159 countries.

This means that advertisers pay only when they see results and internet marketers are rewarded for each visitor or customer acquired through their own marketing efforts. This method incentivizes and rewards publishers and advertisers alike.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create an affiliate marketing network which is completely impervious to ad fraud and payout problems. Bitcomo's business model is anchored by blockchain technology and the immutable proof and transparency this provides. This ensures the security of each user's data, whilst simplifying the interactions between them. Blockchain also eliminates unnecessary intermediaries between a company and its target audience. With less steps linking advertisers and their potential clients, companies can invest their advertising budget more wisely and profitably.\r\n\r\nPart of the next generation of CPA networks, Bitcomo is designed to help businesses reduce their advertising costs while increasing their impact.

There’s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">(Siacoin)</a> to identity verification <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\">(Civic)</a>. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin’s</a> original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we’ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.","twitter_screen_name":"breadapp","facebook_username":"breadapp","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/breadwallet","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1440/small/bread.png?1547563238","country_origin":"CH","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1513382400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"44.137","developer_score":"78.229","community_score":"9.394","liquidity_score":"27.418","public_interest_score":"37.785","total_supply":"88862718","circulating_supply":"60024143.8917","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

With so many new coins available, and over 70% of coins failing in the last 2 years alone, Bulwark wants to implement a long-term, a sustainable platform focused on utility, not hype. They launched their platform and coin with a soft launch and did not have an ICO.\r\n\r\nThe Bulwark coin and platform are based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pivx\">PIVX</a> cryptocurrency, which was built based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dash\">DASH</a> platform. Bulwark coin (BWK) uses a NIST5 hash algorithm, and all blocks are completed within 90 seconds.\r\n\r\nBulwark developed a fair mining protocol to prevent anyone superior node from solving blocks too quickly, which eliminates the chances that one miner would monopolize the mining process by using the superior equipment. Bulwark uses a Dark Gravity Wave concept which retargets the Proof of Work difficulty. This technology adapts to large nethash speed fluctuations, which results in no one person being able to add a large amount of computing power to instantly solve multiple blocks.\r\n\r\nAfter 960 blocks are solved, Bulwark will start integrating a Proof of Stake concept. They will slowly start using Proof of Stake, allowing, at first, 20% of BWK to be minted, and 80% to be mined.

It works by locating dense clusters of prime numbers beginning at a number n, where there are six consecutive prime numbers: n, n+4, n+6, n+10, n+12, and n+16.  To decipher a block, there is hashing of the block contents to generate a target number.  The objective is to locate a prime chain within a particular numerical space greater than the target number. Unlike with other cryptocurrencies that employ similar algorithms, our motivation is not to break any world records in finding prime numbers. We are utilizing this method of mining to make CPU mining more attainable while eliminating the use of GPU & ASIC miners.\r\n\r\nProof of Miner is an innovative mining system that employs captcha technology to limit mining abuses while keeping the mining process tangible. POM requires miners to enter a human readable captcha code every sixty minutes to maintain the mining process without interruption. Mining time can be extended without entering the captcha code by storing x amount of coins in the local wallet. For example, if 25 Bytecents are required to extend mining time for one hour, a miner will need a total of 600 Bytecents stored in his/her local wallet to extend mining time for a total of 24 hours. Coins utilized for mining can be used anytime and are not locked from being spent like with Proof of Stake coins. The number of coins required to extend mining time is based on numerous factors including current price, total volume, and demand.","twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"bytecent","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"845848","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bytecent","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/199/small/bytecent.png?1547033953","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1415491200000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"14.808","developer_score":"0","community_score":"17.051","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"25.54","total_supply":"33000000","circulating_supply":"2728430.33213393","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\n<b>Technological Innovation</b>\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\n<b>Conceptual Innovation</b>\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\r\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\r\n\r\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\r\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano’s wide-ranging potential\r\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Focus:\r\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\r\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\r\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in joining Cardano.\r\n4. Serving the wider blockchain community - We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. We proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.\r\n\r\nIOHK\r\nFounded in 2015 by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a> and <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/jeremy-wood/\">Jeremy Wood</a>, IOHK is a world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to three billion people that don’t have them. The group is contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\r\n\r\nEmurgo\r\n<a href=\"https://emurgo.io/\">Emurgo</a> is the venture building entity in the Cardano ecosystem, its goal is to aid, integrate, and foster Cardano blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nEmurgo captures the transformative power that blockchain technology brings to the developing world. Decentralized applications built on Cardano technology, funded and supported by Emurgo, will have the potential to build groundbreaking applications.\r\n\r\nProject Road Map\r\nIOHK has now released the settlement layer. This means you can transact, trade, and purchase Ada tokens fully independently of the computation layer. The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, users will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.\r\nIn 2019, IOHK intends to work on Cardano’s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that is capable of funding and supporting itself.","twitter_screen_name":"CardanoStiftung","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/975/small/cardano.png?1547034860","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"69.647","developer_score":"83.185","community_score":"59.425","liquidity_score":"68.754","public_interest_score":"36.536","total_supply":"45000000000","circulating_supply":"31112484646","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Put simply Carebit is revolutionising the charity world by leveraging blockchain technology to provide transparent end to end tracking of charitable donations. Carebit will consist of two funds. One emergency fund to respond to disaster situations and one fund which partners with existing charities.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Carebit offers an ability to earn a passive income by staking Carebit coins (PoS) or running a Masternode.\r\n\r\nWe have created our own cryptocurrency with the vision of being able to trace donated funds via the blockchain, from the initial donation through to delivery to the end recipient. Capturing the funds on the blockchain provides full end to end audit trail and allows almost instant transfer of funds via Carebit coins to anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is trade in Carebit rather than fiat. For example, vendors may list Carebit as an option to buy their goods. Donations are raised in Carebit and sent to the recipient charitable organisation who will use the Carebit coins to purchase the required goods directly from the vendor. This end to end movement of Carebit is captured on the blockchain via the Fund Tracking tool, which is currently under development. The vendor is then able to convert Carebit into fiat.\r\n\r\nBefore Carebit is widely accepted we will develop an interim step where we plan to load Master cards with Carebit coins, enabling goods to be easily purchased. All transactions will be fully transparent and declared.

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.\r\n\r\nAtom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.","twitter_screen_name":"cosmos","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1481/small/cosmos_hub.png?1555657960","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"55.557","developer_score":"66.198","community_score":"25.64","liquidity_score":"61.684","public_interest_score":"41.381","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"241074796.005091","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It’s a protocol, set of specifications, and an API. Taken together, it allows users to create and trade assets on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. In this way, Counterparty is similar to platforms like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waves\">Waves</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. Of course, the difference is Counterparty integrates directly with Bitcoin. Therefore, it comes will all the security and reliability (and issues) that are part of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a fairly old project. In fact, it pre-dates Ethereum with its launch in 2014. It was the original asset creation mechanism. As you’re probably aware, Counterparty has faded from prominence over the years. This is largely due to the rise of the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nWhile we’ve become used to calling blockchain assets, tokens, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. An asset can represent anything that has value or is rare. As a result, Counterparty steers clear of the word “token” in their marketing and documentation. They’re much more interested in digital assets of all kinds, not just currencies, securities, and utility tokens. Digital assets can be a digital marker of a physical object, an easy way to manage shares in your company, or reputation karma for a website. These are all types of assets you could create on Counterparty (or Ethereum or Waves, for that matter). Counterparty creates the set of rules, requirements, integrations, etc that are necessary for assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s the infrastructure behind user-created assets in much the same way that the ERC-20 protocol sets up guidelines and standards for asset creation on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nOne useful function of digital assets is as a marker of ownership or voting rights. Imagine a scenario where you issued a digital asset to each of your company’s board members in proportion to the amount of voting power held. Or if you gave your stockholders a digital asset as a marker of the amount of stock they owned. If you issued your stock asset, you could then use Counterparty’s distribution function to pay out dividends in BTC based on the amount of digital stock asset each person owned.\r\n\r\nCounterparty addresses many of the same issues as Ethereum or Waves, but on the Bitcoin blockchain. While that does come with some advantages, ultimately it is not as strong a platform for development as its competitors. It’s best suited for applications that need to interface with Bitcoin or assets that have a specific connection to the Bitcoin ecosystem.","twitter_screen_name":"CounterpartyXCP","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"395761","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/counterparty_xcp/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9/small/counterparty.png?1547033623","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1388620800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"44.052","developer_score":"75.406","community_score":"38.59","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"31.853","total_supply":"2649272","circulating_supply":"2615475","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

From being totally paper based, it is now very much a digital market. In spite of the efficiency brought by digital coupons, the underlying payment processes remain overly complex with middlemen adding unnecessary costs. While the digital coupons can bring a fresh user experience and widen consumer reach, billions of consumers are still confined to a passive role as in a B2C market. Mezzofy (Hong Kong) Limited (“Mezzofy”) has become one of the market leaders in Hong Kong and Asia and the Mezzofy Group now wishes to take a leadership role in delivering the efficiencies that blockchain unlocks, combining innovation in point of sale technology, coupon authentication techniques, the near ubiquitous use of social media and last, but by no means least, a considerably more fluid payments and settlements system. In so doing, it has the full support of a long list of high profile international brands.\r\n\r\nTo execute these changes, the Mezzofy Group is now embarking on a Token Generation Event (TGE), seeking to raise US$24 million. It is well positioned to deliver on these innovations. It has already issued more than 200,000,000 coupons and numbers such well-known brand names as Maxims Group, Starbucks and the Hong Kong Airport Authority among its existing client base. It plans to use the funds to significantly enhance the user experience in the B2C coupon market and to extend it into the still dormant B2B and C2C spheres.","twitter_screen_name":"Coupon_chain","facebook_username":"CouponChain","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"4989769","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8561/small/TBXsczUs-6Eb4cuxDUpLoJS6Iyi8GlzdWe9kJ2NkPBtNNVF97fIXlEWT_4--TP9GgT4N4hq-L8jj0CR3RwojKOLpv0bzTlBvqG-kdzsPbnsbBSxvzRfmWY44NqAMSMmSIbaxN_gBD-deMa1dD5ytVOtScuvJCZfnOwaQjbDRNT4NYemnXp7O2m-PKH6gey89XRDYDyBqPyNetaxG-.jpg?1559200490","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"10.278","developer_score":"0","community_score":"8.62","liquidity_score":"23.881","public_interest_score":"33.473","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It’s a project from 5miles, a leading e-commerce company and app in the United States. With CyberMiles, 5miles hopes to create the protocols and a library of smart contracts for the future of e-commerce. It accomplishes these goals with high throughput delegated proof of stake consensus and a new virtual machine, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine.\r\n\r\nLast November, CyberMiles raised $30 million in an ICO, distributing 420 million CMT. The roadmap for the project indicates that the 5miles e-commerce app, along with its 12 million users, will begin accepting CMT as payment beginning this summer. At the end of this year, CyberMiles hopes to launch the v1.0 of its blockchain.\r\n\r\nCyberMiles is banking a lot of its potential success on the fact that it will launch to 5miles’s user base. 5 miles is one of the top 10 most popular e-commerce apps in the United States. It has 12 million total users and does an estimated $3 billion in revenue annually.\r\n\r\nIf 5miles can get even a small portion of that $3 billion to transact in CMT, then it could be a huge boon for the token and the idea of blockchain e-commerce. Launching a platform at this scale comes with its own challenges and excitement. If the 5miles app successfully transitions to a blockchain-based backend, then it would be one of the largest enterprise applications of blockchain to date.","twitter_screen_name":"cybermiles","facebook_username":"cybermiles","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberMiles","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1300/small/cybermiles.png?1547035327","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1512432000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"41.798","developer_score":"15.935","community_score":"42.506","liquidity_score":"54.916","public_interest_score":"26.736","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"800000000","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Digix has two cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digix-gold\">Digix Gold (DGX)</a> and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger’s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/digixdao-introduces-gold-tokens-ethereum\">introduced a new Proof of Asset protocol</a> (POA).\r\n\r\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault. \r\n\r\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO. When DGX goes live, it will be available for purchase with Ether on the Digix marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","twitter_screen_name":"digixglobal","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1417151","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/digix/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/397/small/dgd.png?1547034124","country_origin":"SG","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"45.052","developer_score":"46.115","community_score":"38.323","liquidity_score":"36.191","public_interest_score":"30.315","total_supply":"1999999","circulating_supply":"1999999","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The smart contract, as the essential part of the eCoinomic.net platform, enforces the fulfillment of the loan agreement and monitors the current rates on the exchanges. \r\n\r\nAbout us write 100+ media mentions such as Forbes, De Center, Coinspeaker etc.We obtained a legal opinion for European Union and Korea from KPMG, JIPYONG and other reputable law firms. CNC token was acknowledged to be the utility token. CNC token is a utility token, which is used to pay commissions for loan contracts. The life cycle of the CNC token implies a gradual reduction of the overall number of tokens in circulation, which never goes down to zero. All tokens that have not been sold during the ICO are to be destroyed. All platform commissions are indicated in USD but are accepted only in the form of tokens All the tokens once accepted as a commission payment are blocked for a period of five years. These principles lead to the constant increase in the value of CNC, whereas token divisibility allows payments with its hundredth or thousandth parts. The team of more than 80 highly qualified experts creates a global network that lends fiat money to individuals and small businesses using crypto assets as a collateral. Thus, there is no necessity any more to sell crypto assets to get money. eCoinomic.net project got the operating licenses from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications of Estonia: -Operating license FVR000181: Providing services of exchanging a virtual currency against a fiat currency -Operating license FRK000150: Providing a virtual currency wallet service Highest score at ratings   The best experts of TOP ICO Ratings evaluated eCoinomic.net ICO with highest rate!

With immediate benefits to the mobile operators in those regions, including meaningful transactional cost savings, there are operators who could take us to well over 100 million users and many more operators in negotiation. Our unique mobile miner puts a small amount of ETN into the hands of users every day, providing market liquidity and driving viral growth. With 2,341,445 million registered users, we have a faster viral growth than both Facebook and Twitter over the same time period.\r\n\r\nThe Electroneum manage to raise 40 million dollars through <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/electroneum\">ICO</a>. Their Github release was November 1st. However, before the launch of the mobile app, they were hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The team had to shut down their servers and work over 26 hours straight to deal with the attack. Eventually, after some delay, ICO investors were distributed their coins and Electroneum continued working towards their goal of spreading ETN to the masses. Over 690 million ETN were transferring during the first 24 hours, requiring only 430 ETN in fees. Electroneum calls itself the first British based cryptocurrency. The team of 12, based in Kent, is led by Richard Ells, the co-founder of SiteWizard and Retortal.com. James Atkinson is the head of the Electroneum Development Team with over 10 years of experience in development. He’s leading the charge on the Electroneum App. Great respect is given to Dean Cole, the “member of the team with the least sleep… consuming giant quantities of caffeine.” He maintains and develops the servers required for mining and transacting in Electroneum.\r\n\r\nThere are several gambling websites already accepting <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, but the problem is that it’s hard for most people to obtain it. The majority of online gambling takes place outside of America, where it’s especially hard to acquire Bitcoin. Most countries do not have access to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\">Coinbase</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini\">Gemini</a> and their local exchanges often have 7% fees or higher. Electroneum once again hopes to reduce friction and encouraging gambling sites to accept the currency. As mentioned previously, due to the ASIC resistant nature of the Electroneum mining algorithm, it’s still feasible to mine coins with just your CPU. You can complete a quick download and join a mining pool right away here. The average block reward is about 7000 ETN.\r\n\r\nElectroneum has also increased its palatability to the average consumer by capping the total number of coins at 21 billion, moving the decimal point two places to the right when compared to Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million. Whereas a pizza in Bitcoin might cost 0.005 BTC, with Electroneum it would be a much more ‘real money’ figure. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ells-8b0615b/\">Richard Ells</a>, founder of Electroneum and experienced tech entrepreneur, said: “I don’t know if you’ve ever tried buying any Bitcoin, but it’s really hard to do!

Enjin is the “largest gaming community platform online” with over 250,000 gaming communities and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that’s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.\r\n\r\nEnjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It’s also one of the first projects testing the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a>, Ethereum’s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we’ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that’s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc…) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform – over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it’s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They’ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\r\n\r\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual gaming with decentralized technologies. Enjin Coin project promises a lot, and it is only with the passage of time that we will able to see if it can deliver on those promises.","twitter_screen_name":"enjin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2042871","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnjinCoin","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1102/small/enjin-coin-logo.png?1547035078","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1506902400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"52.78","developer_score":"48.416","community_score":"54.933","liquidity_score":"45.445","public_interest_score":"36.117","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"875679781.0642638","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share. The competitors includes: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum_classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> which is the oldchain of Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\">Qtum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">Neo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/icon\">Icon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano\">Cardano</a>.\r\n\r\nEthereum wallets are fairly simple to set up with multiple popular choices such as myetherwallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask?locale=en\">metamask</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review\">Trezor</a>.

Individuals interacting on Ethereum Classic are governed by this reality; \r\n\r\nCode is Law. This does not necessarily mean that code replaces existing laws, or that only code is law (there are many geographical jurisdictions), but it gives users the opportunity to enter into a new blockchain-based jurisdiction where agreements are governed by code.\r\n\r\nBy entering into contracts on Ethereum Classic, you can be certain that the network remains neutral. The outcome of transactions will be dictated by code you voluntarily interact with. Unless explicitly defined by the contract code, there are no reversals, no undos, no opt-outs.\r\n\r\nTransactions are final; applications are unstoppable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecentralized Governance\r\n\r\nThere are many problems that fester due to centralization and opaqueness; corruption, unaccountability, nepotism, inefficiency and stagnation. Ultimately, centralization leads to fragility; only decentralized systems can stand the test of time.\r\n\r\nThese problems can be only solved by adhering to governance systems that do not rely on a central point of failure. Just like distributed networks and the consensus protocol itself, we believe that only truly decentralized projects can survive in the long run.\r\n\r\nEthereum Classic manifests these values by relinquishing control by a formalized central foundation. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation. No backroom deals or behind-closed-doors unilateral decision making; just free and open discourse.\r\n","twitter_screen_name":"eth_classic","facebook_username":"ethereumclassic","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1559630","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/453/small/ethereum-classic-logo.png?1547034169","country_origin":"CH","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1438214400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"64.101","developer_score":"74.114","community_score":"43.179","liquidity_score":"75.959","public_interest_score":"37.622","total_supply":"230000000","circulating_supply":"111763591","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The team is on a mission to solve one of crypto’s most prominent issues – illiquidity. Most investors have experienced this first-hand: You find a digital asset you like and want to invest in. However, the coin is only available on a handful of exchanges. On top of that, you can only use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> to trade for it. This leads to a sometimes hour-long process filled with multiple manual transfers over at least two exchanges.\r\n\r\nPayment channels provide an instant way to transfer digital assets off-chain between two parties. The transactions are only recorded on the blockchain when the payment channel is first opened and when it’s closed. You can think of it as updating balances on both ends of the channel for each transfer. Once you close the payment channel, both parties get their respective final balances. Payment channels are trustless – any disputes are resolved automatically through cryptography. And, transfers using them are secured by the underlying blockchain making them as reliable as exchanges on the blockchain itself. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a> are two of the most popular examples of payment channels.\r\n\r\nJames Wo (CEO), Terry Culver (CSO), Mikael Wang (Chief Blockchain Architect), and Kilian Rausch (Product Director) lead the Exchange Union management team. The team has extensive blockchain experience with some impressive positions on their resumes. Wo is the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Digital Finance Group – the world’s leading blockchain focused business group. Wang was formally the CTO of BTCC as well as a Chief Solutions Architect at Ericsson. Rausch was previously the PO at Mobi, a leading digital asset wallet.\r\n\r\nBridge digital currency exchanges around the world and realize investors’ cross-exchange trading, cross-exchange clearing, deposits and withdrawals among different digital currencies and assets. Improve trading efficiency and performance of exchanges and realize the market-oriented distribution of digital currencies’ liquidity and best price offers.First, bridge the exchanges in terms of trading, deposits, withdrawals and clearing through agreements among digital currency exchanges and offer discounts on trading fees; provide deals on credit and margin trading.

By creating a data layer on top of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain, Factom’s distributed ledger technology secures millions of real-time records in the blockchain with a single hash using cryptographic isolation. Businesses and governments alike can use Factom to document their information so that it cannot be modified, deleted or backdated. Factom’s technology decentralizes record keeping by ensuring that the integrity of stored data remains intact, providing complete transparency, while at the same time maintaining user privacy in an increasingly digital world.\r\n\r\nThe Factom project began in 2014 which puts it on the older end of the blockchain spectrum. The team has made steady progress since then. They released the first version of Factom in early 2015 and had their token sale in the middle of that year. In August of 2015, they were accepted into the Plug and Play FinTech accelerator and were chosen as one of Austin’s A-List start-ups in May 2016. Based out of Austin, TX, the core team has multiple members with several years of experience in the blockchain space. Peter Kirby, Factom Co-founder and CEO, and Abhi Dobhal, VP Product Management, previously worked together at CoinTerra, Inc – a producer of ASIC miners for Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe price of a Factoid is directly tied to the amount of network usage. As more businesses join the network, it will become more costly to submit Entries which will, in turn, affect the Factoid price. Once the number of Factoids being burned outpaces the 73,000 that are created each month, the currency will become deflationary. This may drive the price up even further.","twitter_screen_name":"factom","facebook_username":"FactomProject","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"850070","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/factom","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/310/small/factom.png?1547034074","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1441065600000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"49.044","developer_score":"65.038","community_score":"45.64","liquidity_score":"22.178","public_interest_score":"33.749","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"9654551.154","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM’s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes’ clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this ‘Dynamic Proof of Location’ is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace’s control.","twitter_screen_name":"foamspace","facebook_username":"foamprotocol","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/foamprotocol/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/small/K51lJQc.png?1547037959","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1532736000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"26.962","developer_score":"0","community_score":"36.277","liquidity_score":"8.571","public_interest_score":"33.186","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"331833459.0078","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Most people introduced to the global content industry will identify the following problems with the current model:\r\nThe Gifto network was launched in December 2017 and has been tested along with AIG’s flagship product, Uplive.

The universal blockchain-based virtual gifting protocol has not only bridged the gap between content creators and the audience but has also introduced a way to acknowledge and reward the content creators. Besides monetizing decentralized content, it has revamped the modern creator-audience relationship.\r\n\r\nIt has already received support from a number of large institutional investors including KPCB and Wicklow Capital.

The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we’re just going to focus on their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events. \r\n\r\nUsers in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia is Gnosis’s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product, so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a beta version in December 2017 but haven’t announced a date for the main net release. The Management Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis’s prediction markets. It’s here that you check your balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.\r\n\r\nGnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren’t minting any additional ones. These are the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL usage over the previous 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe Gnosis team is led by Martin Köppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO). Köppelmann and George began working on the platform in January 2015 as one of the first ConsenSys partners. By August of that same year, they launched the alpha product as the first major dapp on Ethereum. In April 2017, the project held somewhat of a controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/gnosis\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>. Using a dutch auction style of raising funds, the team hit their $12.5 million hard cap in ten minutes while retaining 95% of the tokens. Amidst backlash, the team locked the tokens in a vault and have promised not to dump them on the market. They’ll give at least a three-month warning before selling any of the tokens. The team includes quite a list of reputable advisors including Joseph Lubin (Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder and chief scientist).","twitter_screen_name":"gnosisPM","facebook_username":"Gnosis.pm","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1529098","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gnosisPM","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/662/small/gnosis-logo.png?1547034401","country_origin":"DE","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1492473600000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"44.207","developer_score":"52.556","community_score":"44.898","liquidity_score":"15.024","public_interest_score":"37.229","total_supply":"10000000","circulating_supply":"1104590","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\r\n\r\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company’s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.","twitter_screen_name":"h_o_l_o_","facebook_username":"holohost","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2963267","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/holochain","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3348/small/Holologo_Profile.png?1547037966","country_origin":"GI","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"61.159","developer_score":"81.03","community_score":"47.744","liquidity_score":"53.649","public_interest_score":"32.319","total_supply":"177619433541","circulating_supply":"177619433541","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi’s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binancecoin\">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>. The creation of BNB secured Binance’s place as the world’s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\r\n\r\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, “not an ICO,” due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi’s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That’s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.\r\n\r\nHuobi isn’t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox (BIX)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kucoin-shares\">KuCoin (KCS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coss\">Coss (COSS)</a> have all issued their own tokens as well.","twitter_screen_name":"HuobiGlobal","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/huobi/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2822/small/huobi-token-logo.png?1547036992","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1517356800000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"39.476","developer_score":"0","community_score":"31.029","liquidity_score":"62.47","public_interest_score":"32.868","total_supply":"500000000","circulating_supply":"256167330.4137488","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Users virtually “buy and sell” such “outcome shares” based on what they see as the probability at any given moment and agree on a virtual “price” that such transactions will occur.

Consistently recognized as one of the world’s most innovative blockchain projects, Komodo is developing technologies at the cutting-edge of the blockchain industry. \r\n\r\nIn reality, most blockchain platforms today are but a single blockchain that offers support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth. \r\n\r\nWhereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo’s federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain. \r\n\r\nThis multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo’s infinitely scalable infrastructure. \r\n\r\nKomodo’s tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with Komodo’s architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. If one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency. \r\n\r\nThe Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it’s also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network.

It was created based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\">Scrypt proof of work</a> mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\">Coinbase</a>, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a>) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.","twitter_screen_name":"litecoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"47417","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2/small/litecoin.png?1547033580","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1318032000000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"73.018","developer_score":"71.439","community_score":"65.169","liquidity_score":"87.216","public_interest_score":"39.541","total_supply":"84000000","circulating_supply":"62554440.774021","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Loopring has quickly gained visibility as one of the decentralized exchange options that’s making progress on trading across multiple blockchains. Loopring’s solution utilizes ring transactions and order matching to facilitate asset exchanges. Essentially, it aggregates the order books of other exchanges. This allows any exchange, decentralized or centralized, to utilize Loopring’s protocol to match orders. Part of providing an open protocol is remaining blockchain agnostic. Hence, the first <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/loopring\">Loopring token (LRC)</a> was launched on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, but it also plans to launch <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/loopring-neo\">Loopring NEO (LRN)</a> and Loopring QTUM (LRQ).\r\n\r\nThe plans to launch Loopring NEO are coming along. The distribution of the new tokens, LRN, has already begun. Essentially, the token distribution involves two phases: an investor sale and an airdrop. This guide will look at both phases, how to buy LRN, and what to expect from Loopring NEO.\r\n\r\nThe big selling point of Loopring’s exchange solution is you never have to deposit funds to Loopring. With most exchanges, even other decentralized exchanges, you still have to transfer funds to their wallets. On Loopring, you can keep your funds in your own private wallet when trading.\r\n\r\nOf course, that creates a challenge for Loopring because the exchange no longer controls the wallet and that means smart contracts need to do the work of verifying that transactions are legitimate and confirmed. When a trade occurs, it happens user to user, with no middleman. Loopring finds the match and coordinates the terms of the trade, but it never controls the assets.\r\n\r\nLoopring is one of the first projects to attempt launching across multiple blockchain ecosystems. This experiment is interesting and exciting. It also has the potential to be lucrative if Loopring continues to increase in value.","twitter_screen_name":"loopringorg","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/loopring/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4064/small/2693.png?1547039210","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"25.257","developer_score":"56.795","community_score":"32.614","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"27.051","total_supply":"139507605","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The Lunyr ICO ended on 26th April 2017, with around USD 0.3 million in capital being generated. The open beta was then launched on 30th January 2018. It is based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The reward system which enables writers to earn rewards for authoring articles was also launched at the same time, allowing writers to earn LUN coins in exchange for quality pieces.

This innovative feature can be used in applications ranging from Virtual Reality to Artificial Intelligence. The decentralised and peer-to-peer nature of Lunyr allows all content on the knowledge-base to be free from manipulation, and censorship.

Docademic has created Free Basic Healthcare for the world through Telemedicine. Now offering its service in 20 countries in LatAm, Docademic has thousands of users and is putting all the data on an innovative healthcare blockchain. Docademic´s ICO token economics are amazing and were calculated based on how much money is needed to expand to the US and Europe. By providing Free Basic Healthcare for the world not only is Docademic revolutionizing helathcare access, its also one of the most significant blockchain and tech projects ever. Docademic is proud to be John McAfees choice for a Healthcare blockchain!\r\n\r\nThe DOCADEMIC PLATFORM is a single globally-sourced healthcare service platform for the public that begins with free Human Doctor-AI assisted Video Telemedicine service (DOCADEMIC APP) already in use in 20 countries by thousands of users and an associated suite of AI assisted tools and social network for the medical community (Docademic for Doctors). Combined, these produce the highest level of free basic quality healthcare allowing any individual to access the benefits and knowledge of healthcare that technology now permits.\r\n\r\nThe DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC APP is built on top of DOCADEMIC´s existing, patient data routing and AI assisted technologies soon to be blockchain enabled. With its simplicity of use It becomes the ultimate resource for anyone who needs orientation in a health-related issue—a one touch system that connects any patient with a Doctor through Video Telemedicine for free, from any country a user is located in. All patient information will be secured on a blockchain and represents a perfect On-Ramp to healthcare services on a blockchain. In comparison, other healthcare related blockchain projects don’t have an effective On-Ramp to healthcare services. With our free Telemedicine service we can get the masses to benefit from blockchain technology in Healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe DOCADEMIC PLATFORM´s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network offers Ongoing Medical education, Patient referrals, Tools for doctors everyday practice, and Real Time Reporting of epidemiological data for our clients and researchers.

It is a system that rewards users who engage in “social mining”. Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\r\n\r\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale=en\">MyCrypto</a>, or Coinfy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space. If Mithril gets its way, centralized social networking companies may soon have worthy competitors that offer users more control of their data while rewarding people for creating the content that is ultimately the life-blood of all social networks.","twitter_screen_name":"MithrilToken","facebook_username":"MithrilToken","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"3108554","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MithrilToken/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3484/small/mithril.png?1548085086","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1515369600000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"37.687","developer_score":"17.057","community_score":"33.603","liquidity_score":"44.264","public_interest_score":"33.279","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"433840806.16803014","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The MCO Token Sale was conducted in May-June 2017 and raised US$26.7 million. \r\n\r\nMCO Card is a Visa-branded debit card that draws from a cryptocurrency-funded bank account. Since it’s a Visa card, you can use your MCO Visa card just like you would any other card. The card and bank account are free for holders of cryptocurrency. In order to open an account, you simply sign up, verify your identity, and transfer any of the various accepted cryptocurrencies to your account. At this time, the Visa card is available to customers in Asia. They also have a waitlist for European customers. Customers in the United States does not have access to it at the moment. However, there are plans to change that. Solving the problem of everyday payments has the potential to be huge for cryptocurrency. However, MCO Visa card is not the only project attempting to create crypto-backed debit (or prepaid) cards. Other projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tenx\">TenX</a>, are working on the same issue. All of these projects run into challenges implementing such cards in a large scale, compliant manner. Crypto.com hopes to crack the code, ultimately getting cryptocurrencies and popular payment methods to play nicely together.\r\n\r\nCrypto.com was founded in June 2016 in Switzerland and rebranded from Monaco on 6th July 2018. Their first prototype was developed in October of that year. In February of 2017, they were accepted into a Hong Kong Government backed Cyberport incubation program, where they developed their platform until they were ready to launch their token sale in 2017. The sale closed in June with $26.7 million in funding. Their app became available to pre-registered users in August 2017, followed by the official partnership with Visa in October. The team consists of seasoned veterans in the fin-tech space, most of whom have experience in Asia, where Monaco Cards have first been made available.\r\n\r\nSince MCO Visa cards are backed by cryptocurrency, they don’t have border issues like fiat currencies. As a result, you can use your card anywhere you go. The card will automatically default to the local fiat currency when you make a purchase. The low fees and exchange rates also apply in other countries. Transactions take place at the exact exchange rate that Crypto.com receives as an institutional trader. In contrast, when you use your debit card across borders with most banks, they’ll add an additional percentage to the exchange rate or include a transaction fee. Crypto.com has connections with eight of the top ten international foreign exchange banks to facilitate currency conversion.\r\n\r\nThe MCO Visa card is a compelling option for anyone looking to make everyday purchases with cryptocurrency. It also makes sense for cross-border travelers. However, we can expect the rollout to take a long time and hit a lot of bumps along the way. The financial industry is highly regulated and cryptocurrency-backed payments is a complex issue, even if Crypto.com's solution seems to make it simple and user-friendly.","twitter_screen_name":"cryptocom","facebook_username":"CryptoComOfficial","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1926269","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/739/small/mco.png?1548387054","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1498435200000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"31.719","developer_score":"0","community_score":"18.229","liquidity_score":"45.222","public_interest_score":"39.977","total_supply":"31587682","circulating_supply":"15793829.96","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Part of Monero's development is that it hard-forks every 6 months, this is completely normal so not a surprise. After one of these scheduled hard-forks Monero retains the ticker symbol 'XMR' as well as the upgrades from the hard-fork; on the 6th April hard-fork it had changes including resistance to Cryptonight ASIC miners. If people disagree with these hard-forks, they can create their own versions of Monero. The strong financial incentives against this hard-fork, resulted in 4 different entities that each has created versions of Monero that still support ASIC miners, with their own new ticker symbols:\r\n\r\nMonero (XMR), the coin supported by the core Monero development team \r\nMonero Original (XMO), announced on 29th March \r\nMonero 0 (ZMR), shared on Reddit on 31st March 2018 \r\nMoneroClassic (XMC), first Tweet on 4th April 2018 \r\nMonero-Classic (XMC), first Tweet on 5th April 2018\r\n\r\nOn the project website, the person behind Monero-Classic identifies himself as “PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder”.  PZ's message on the website:\r\n\r\nHello, everyone! I'm PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder. Most of you know me because of my efforts and adherence to the ecological development of blockchain industry. In the past few years, I saw Bitcoin community and Litecoin community both fell apart for long time due to different ideas , and the development of main chains was unable to move forward. So I organized Litecoin International Round Table Forum and Bitcoin International Round Table Forum in 2017. The two meetings were very successful. The upgrade of Litecoin and Bitcoin also went on successfully.\r\n\r\nRecently, our team noticed that XMR (Monero), the world’s largest anonymous currency, is about to change the PoW algorithm, and plans to further change it twice within 1 year. As we all know, the reason for this algorithm change is that many companies (BITMAIN, PinIdea, etc.) have developed specialized mining machines for Monero. \r\n\r\nActually, the emergence of specialized mining machine for a cryptocurrency is normal market economy phenomenon. In the 10 years since the cryptocurrency community was born, we have seen the birth of specialized mining machine for Bitcoin. Then there emerged Litecoin, which was expected to be against specialized ASIC mining machines, using script algorithm which was considered to be\"against ASIC\" at that time. While after only two years, there appeared specialized mining machine for Litecoin. We considered about whether to change algorithm to be against specialized ASIC mining machines or not. However, after prudent and serious discussion, we believe that for any kind of valuable algorithm, the emergence of mining machine is only a matter of time. Finally, we made our choice to accept the existence of professional mining machines. Now more and more high-value currencies (algorithms) have respondent specialized ASIC mining machines, which has become a common phenomenon in the industry. \r\n\r\nIs the existence of specialized mining machines completely useless? Obviously, this argument is unfair. The emergence of specialized mining machines will indeed accelerate the rise of problems such as centralization of computational power. But we should be reminded the fact that emergence of professional mining machines will also greatly improve network security. If there are professional mining machines, the events like “Monero was attacked by more than 500,000 botnets” could be avoided. \r\n\r\nWe understand that Monero team expects to stick to the expectations and work of Monero's “against ASIC mining machine”. For a long time, due to the excellent work of Monero team, XMR and its community have achieved great development, providing much valuable contributions to the entire cryptocurrency community. In the community, many people agree with this hard fork of changing algorithms. However, I feel that there is still a part of people who want to maintain the original algorithm and accept the existence of mining machines. They should be heard and respected. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the two ideas of \"embrace ASIC mining machines\" and \"against ASIC mining machines\" both have their own strengths and weakness. At present, the vigorous development of the global cryptocurrency ecology is precisely due to the emergence of various ideas of different people. The collision of different ideas has brought out the flourishing of various digital currencies. We always believe that the ecological diversity of cryptocurrency community is much conducive to the birth of a more secure, stable, prosperous and beautiful encrypted world.

{"_id":"nav-coin","homepage":["http://www.navcoin.org"],"blockchain_site":["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/","https://www.navexplorer.com"],"github":["https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core","https://github.com/NAVCoin/npips","https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-dev-tools"],"bitbucket":[],"description":"NavCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses the peer-to-peer blockchain technology to operate with no central authority managing its transactions. The issuance of NavCoin is carried out collectively by the network of miners and joint development by the NavCoin commmunity. The project is open-source and decentralized. Nobody owns or have complete controls over the cryptocurrency. The NavCoin project is open source and available for everyone to take part. NavCoin was known as Navajo Coin, which was rebranding from SummerCoinv2.\r\n\r\nNavCoin is cryptocurrency designed to be anonymous and simple to use. Established in 2014, it belongs to an older class of cryptocurrencies that came before the current wave of ICOs. NavCoin has stood the test of time well. Over the past four years it has implemented various upgrades, features, and improvements. The team is dedicated and knowledgeable, and as a result the platform has seen consistent growth. However, NavCoin has not seen the kind of growth that the other competitors in the race to be the top privacy coin have seen. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\">Zcash</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\">Monero</a> have all outstripped NavCoin in terms of adoption and funding. Recently, the project has seen a comeback, as they’ve begun to emphasize design, usability, and experience. NavCoin wants to make it simple and fast to use private transactions.\r\n\r\nSince the early days, one of NavCoin’s strong suits has been its fast transaction times. NavCoin sees block confirmations every thirty seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s ten minutes. This is faster than Monero (2 minutes) and Zcash (2.5 minutes). Dash also averages about 2.5 minute block times, but its masternodes make it possible to send instant transactions. That said, NavCoin has the fastest standard block time of any privacy coin. These fast transactions aren’t expensive either. Where currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are having trouble with high miner fees, NavCoin keeps its transaction costs low. The average fee is only 0.0001 NAV to send a standard transaction. Private, encrypted transactions can be more expensive.\r\n\r\nWhile most other cryptocurrencies implement some form of proof of work mining, NavCoin was among the first to implement proof of stake. Proof of stake relies on users putting up a portion of their NAV holdings in order to gain an opportunity to create a new block. If the network ratifies the new block you created, you’ll receive an award. If your block is bad or contains fraudulent transactions, the proof of work algorithm takes away all the coins you staked. This incentivizes honest block creation. With NavCoin, it’s possible to earn a 5% interest from staking your NAV. In order to do so, however, you’ll need to operate a staking node on the network. You can do this on your computer by downloading the NavCoin Core client and setting the amount of NAV you want to stake.\r\n\r\nThe team behind NavCoin and Valence is Encrypt S Ltd. However, it’s an open source project. As such, they’ve built up a big community following, and anyone can contribute. NavCoin features a very active development team. New updates come out regularly, usually every week. The Lead Engineer is Crag MacGregor. He is also CEO of Encrypt S Ltd. They’re the blockchain development company behind the NavCoin project. He’s from New Zealand. Nav is also one of the most beautiful, easily understood coins out there. This is in large part thanks to their marketing and creative team. NavCoin’s focus on style, branding, and communication sets them apart in blockchain space. Usability is important for adoption of any early-stage project, and it’s nice to see NavCoin taking this element of the platform seriously.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/navcoin-nav/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review of NavCoin.","twitter_screen_name":"navcoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"679791","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NavCoin","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/233/small/83Ih.png?1547033996","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1401667200000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"51.046","developer_score":"76.612","community_score":"45.663","liquidity_score":"22.647","public_interest_score":"33.712","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"65533405.4178108","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

{"_id":"nework","homepage":["http://nework.pro/"],"blockchain_site":[],"github":[],"bitbucket":[],"description":"The bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer payment network that operates on a cryptographic protocol. Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining. Satoshi Nakamoto, the designer of bitcoin claimed that design and coding of bitcoin began in 2007. The project was released in 2009 as open source software. The network requires the minimal structure to share transactions. An ad hoc decentralized network of volunteers is sufficient. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon reconnection, a node downloads and verifies new blocks from other nodes to complete its local copy of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nA bitcoin is defined by a sequence of digitally signed transactions that began with the bitcoin's creation, as a block reward. The owner of a bitcoin transfers it by digitally signing it over to the next owner using a bitcoin transaction, much like endorsing a traditional bank check. A payee can examine each previous transaction to verify the chain of ownership. Unlike traditional check endorsements, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which eliminates the risk of chargeback fraud.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible to handle bitcoins individually, it would be unwieldy to require a separate transaction for every bitcoin in a transaction. Transactions are therefore allowed to contain multiple inputs and outputs, allowing bitcoins to be split and combined. Common transactions will have either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and one or two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, to the sender. Any difference between the total input and output amounts of a transaction goes to miners as a transaction fee.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Mark Gimein estimated electricity consumption to be about 40.9 megawatts (982 megawatt-hours a day). In 2014, Hass McCook estimated 80.7 megawatts (80,666 kW). As of 2015, The Economist estimated that even if all miners used modern facilities, the combined electricity consumption would be 166.7 megawatts (1.46 terawatt-hours per year). To lower the costs, bitcoin miners have set up in places like Iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and cooling Arctic air is free.

Its goal is to establish a network that uses blockchain technology to use decentralized consensus methods to contribute pricing and equity returns to content production. Producers, content investors and content consumers all have reasonable incentives and rewards. Advertisers can also achieve accurate marketing on the platform. \r\n\r\nThe original design of NEWS CHAIN (propaganda chain) is to construct a set of reasonable content flow advertising value evaluation and income distribution mechanism, and build a value network based on user content evaluation. Regardless of text, video, image, audio, or even live broadcast content-based content platforms (including, not limited to websites, Apps, and other forms of expression), the use of communication chains can be used to construct a content incentive platform corresponding to the theme. Between the platforms, the content is evaluated using a\r\nunified content evaluation algorithm, the value of the traffic is evaluated using an effective traffic algorithm, and the advertisement is provided by an accurate marketing algorithm. The content is produced by content producers, content investors, content communicators, and platforms. Constructors, advertisers, etc. will all rely on the ecology of the dissemination chain to obtain appropriate and reasonable returns based on content, traffic value, and precision marketing. \r\n\r\nTherefore, NEWS CHAIN (propagation chain) combines social networks, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchains seamlessly. It will surely enable content-based eco-blockchains based on social networks to create content producers and content consumers.

Nimiq is a CPU only mineable coin, since it uses the Aragon2D algorithm.\r\n\r\nNimiq intends to lower barriers of entry for blockchain technology, and make it accessible for mainstream use.

Nimiq is making blockchain technology as accessible as the internet, with a vision to truly decentralize the web.

Nimiq held its ICO throughout June and July of 2017, and raised over 10 million USD. NET trading was enabled shortly after the ICO, and development began on the project’s Github. NET was converted to NIM, the currency that is based on the Nimiq blockchain and network, on March 31st of 2018. Nimiq’s wallet (Nimiq Safe) is built right into the Nimiq website, which means there is no need to download or sync a wallet application. The wallet will lead you through a setup guide, which will help backup and secure your wallet in the case of data loss.

Because applications can choose to make their back-ends fully open-source and transparent, this new implementation of the World Wide Web is defined as the Open Internet.\r\n\r\nOn nOS, applications and websites can be deployed in a completely open and decentralized manner by integrating smart contracts, client-side code, and public-key cryptography. \r\n\r\nUnlike server-side backend code, smart contracts can be open for all to read, allowing users to review how their data will be transmitted before any final commitments to action. \r\n\r\nClient-side code and other frontend materials can be distributed via nOS Filesystem, a decentralized file sharing protocol that allows for secure and transparent distribution of static files. \r\n\r\nBy serving both backend logic and frontend material in an open-source, decentralized manner, true transparency between user and application can be achieved. \r\n\r\ndApps that are deployed to nOS can be accessed through nOS Client, a software solution for desktop and mobile that (among other features) introduces nOS Browser. \r\n\r\nnOS Browser functions as a web browser, with the added benefit that it integrates with the nOS Protocol, a blockchain-powered web protocol that facilitates secure and open accessibility of nOS dApps.\r\n\r\nThe nOS Protocol resolves domain names that exist on nOS Name Service, a blockchain-powered decentralized implementation of a Domain Name Service, and allows for dApps to register domain names which are discoverable on nOS (e.g. mydapp.neo or my-dapp.eth).\r\n\r\nThe dApp Gateway is a user-friendly dApp discovery platform (or “App Store”) where rankings are decided in a completely decentralized manner via Decentralized Authority.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the features such as the ones described above, nOS is powered by the nOS Utility Token.\r\n\r\nThe nOS Utility Token employs various staking and reward utilities which are intended for developers who wish to deploy and maintain dApps on nOS, and for end-users who wish to practice governance by Decentralized Authority. \r\n\r\nnOS eliminates the need for end-users to manually exchange crypto-currencies in order to make use of various dApps.

Instead of modifying the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\">Bitcoin source code</a>, as many altcoins have done, Nxt developers wrote their own code in Java from scratch. While Nxt is a public blockchain, licenses for private blockchains based on its software are also available for purchase. The developers refer to Nxt as Blockchain 2.0, providing numerous applications beyond simply keeping a public ledger of transactions.\r\n\r\nJelurida BV took over the originally anonymously developed Nxt and now own the IP rights. Kristina Kalcheva, co-founder and legal expert of Jelurida, focuses on how to “explore the different open source licensing models and their enforceability in practice.”  Currently, the main developer is an anonymous Star Trek fan, going by the name Jean-Luc Picard. While there is still the active development of Nxt, the parent company Jelurida is also working on a Nxt 2.0, known as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor</a>, designed specifically to deal with scalability. Ardor will use the same blockchain technology as Nxt, combined with the idea of ‘child chains.’ According to Travin Keith, Nxt foundation Web and Marketing manager, Ardor allows for a “manageable blockchain size, which solves the problem of scalability by separating transactions and data that do not affect security from those that do, and moving all of those that don’t affect security onto child chains.”\r\n\r\nThe core infrastructure of Nxt is complex. This adds risks as compared to the more lean bitcoin, but makes it easier for external services to be built on top of the blockchain. A peer-peer exchange allowing decentralized trading of shares, crypto assets. Since the blockchain is an unalterable public ledger of transactions, the Asset Exchange provides a trading record for items other than Nxt. To do this, Nxt allows the designation or \"\"coloring\"\" of a particular coin, which builds a bridge from the virtual crypto-currency world to the physical world. The \"\"colored coin\"\" can represent property, stocks/bonds, commodities, or even concepts. Arbitrary Messages enable the sending of encrypted or plain text, which can also function to send and store up to 1000 bytes of data permanently, or 42 kilobytes of data for a limited amount of time. As a result, it can be used to build file-sharing services, decentralized applications, and higher-level Nxt services.\r\n\r\nNxt had no mining phase, all initial units were released to 73 people through a one-time fundraiser via bitcoins, after the announcement of the NXT project in the bitcointalk-forums by BCnext. Combine this with a PoS approach, and you have a situation where the big guys run the table. At one point, the Nxt community had a very public spat with Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik. Garzik took issue with the Nxt marketing approach, its anonymous developers, and their responses to constructive criticism. Nxt responded to some of these claims, of course, but it remains one of the more controversial moments in its history.  Another key problem the Nxt network ran into (like so many others) was blockchain bloat. Nodes get weighed down by the onerous task of having to store every transaction on the Nxt blockchain. This was one reason (among others) why Ardor/<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\">Ignis</a> came into existence.\"","twitter_screen_name":"NxtCommunity","facebook_username":"nxtcrypto","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"587007","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NXT/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6/small/nxt.png?1547033614","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1385251200000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"49.787","developer_score":"56.018","community_score":"50.684","liquidity_score":"30.586","public_interest_score":"37.65","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"998999942","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Through the creation of nuanced digital channels, ODEM makes it possible for users to come together to raise the quality of accessible education at a reasonable cost. Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within various industrial sectors. Not only that, ODEM provides students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities, thereby allowing international as well as local students to take ownership of their educations.\r\n\r\nODEM connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract-based payment platform. As a result, academic scholars can interact directly with one another and participate in the exchange of education and learning, without the involvement of intermediaries. This service allows users to access custom-designed courses and educational programs that can help them find a curriculum that meets their particular needs. Unlike the educational model used by online service providers such as Coursera and Khan Academy, where all teacher-student interaction is maintained virtually, ODEM creates customized in-person educational programs that prepare students for real-world jobs and businesses. According to the official whitepaper, the majority of ODEM’s current offerings are onsite educational experiences.\r\n\r\nRichard Maaghul is the CEO of this venture. He has been in the startup domain for over two decades and has been involved with a number of emerging/disruptive technologies in the past. In addition to co-founding ODEM.IO, Rich has been involved with Chevron Corporation as an executive. William Bayrd II is the COO of this project. According to his LinkedIn profile, Bill is the founder of three companies, including big-name establishments such as Excelorators Inc. Bill possesses a D.Pharma from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Michael Zargham is the Chief Backend Engineer for ODEM. He holds a Ph.D in Systems Engineering with a specialization in decentralized systems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Michael possesses more than a decade’s worth of experience in domains such as digital systems and disruptive technology.\r\n\r\nTo invest in this company, we will have to buy its ODEM tokens. They are ERC20 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based tokens which can be used on the educational platform to trade for educational services.

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE’s platform.\r\n\r\nONE is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\nCommunity-owned\r\n51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\r\n\r\nBIG token holders owned\r\n49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\r\n\r\nTrade cryptos in the “Trade-Mining” section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\r\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the “Trade-Mining” section. As incentive, you will receive 20% of your referred new user’s trading fee rebate in the form of ONEs.\r\nBIG tokens stored on BigONE platform will automatically be airdropped ONEs.\r\nHold ONEs, Share All Platform Trading Fee\r\n\r\nEveryday at 00:00 UTC+8, BigONE will take a snapshot according to the current ONE balance on the platform. All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula = number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\r\n\r\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through “Trade-Mining” or “Referral-Mining” or “Airdrop to BIG token holders” until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\r\n\r\n【Trade-Mining】\r\n\r\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the “Trade-Mining” section. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the platform will calculate all trading fees occurred in the “Trade-mining” section during the last 24 hours (from the previous 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) and unlock equivalent worth of ONEs using the average price of ONE on the same day. On the following day’s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the “Trade-mining” section in the previous day.\r\n\r\n【Referral-Mining】\r\n\r\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform’s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users’ tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user’s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\r\n\r\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\r\n\r\n【Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders】\r\n\r\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders’ according to the formula: [Previous day’s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\r\n\r\n【Friendly Tips】\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new “Trade-mining” rule applies and 100% of BigONE's revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\r\n\r\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks. Any investment decisions should be made with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n什么是ONE?\r\n\r\nONE 是 BigONE 平台推出的积分，发行总量恒定200亿，不增发，初始全部冻结，通过创新的“交易即挖矿”机制逐渐解冻。BigONE会将100%的交易手续费收入奖励给ONE的持有者。\r\n\r\nONE 的构成及分配机制\r\n\r\n【归属社区用户部分】占比51%，共计102亿个 ONE，解冻以后可以在 BigONE 平台流通；\r\n【归属BIG Token持有者部分】占比 49%，共计 98 亿个 ONE，将会随社区部分的解冻速度等比例解冻，每天空投给所有 BIG Token 持有者 ，用户因持有BIG Token所获得的ONE梯度解锁（方案待定），而BigONE平台通过持有的BIG Token获得的ONE将锁仓一年（自该部分ONE被自动解冻之日起）。\r\n获得 ONE 的方式\r\n\r\n【交易挖矿专区】交易手续费以等值的 ONE 返还用户。\r\n邀请新用户完成注册及身份认证，邀请者可获得被邀请者挖矿数量的额外的20%的 ONE奖励。\r\n存放于 BigONE 平台的 BIG Token 持有者，会获得逐渐解冻的 ONE 。\r\n持有 ONE 可共享平台全部交易手续费\r\n\r\n每天 00:00 按当时 BigONE 平台内的 ONE 持有快照，将前一天平台上产生的交易手续费（以平台交易币种形式），按「持有ONE的个数 / ONE的累积解冻数量」的比例空投到所有 ONE 持有者的账户。\r\n\r\nONE初始全部冻结，通过【交易挖矿】/【邀请挖矿】/ 【BIG Token 持有者空投】等方式逐步解冻，直至 200 亿个ONE全部解冻。\r\n\r\n【交易挖矿】\r\n\r\n只有在【交易挖矿专区】进行币币之间的交易才能实现交易挖矿。每天 0 点，将前一天（0-24点）用户交易时扣除的手续费，按前一天 ONE 的平均价格快照，换算为等值的若干个ONE解冻，并在当天10点，将解冻的ONE返给在专区内交易挖矿的用户。\r\n\r\n【邀请挖矿】\r\n邀请挖矿是平台给老用户介绍新用户的激励机制。每天 0 点，将前一天（0-24点）被邀请用户交易时扣除的手续费折算成等价的 ONE 之后，按 20% 的比例作为邀请返利，并解冻相应的ONE，在当天 10 点返利给邀请者。\r\n\r\n注意：邀请挖矿的 ONE 属于额外解冻部分，BIG Token 持有者部分也等比会获得解冻。\r\n\r\n【BIG Token 持有者接到空投ONE】\r\n\r\n每日 24 点将对 BigONE 平台上 BIG 余额进行快照，并以此数额为准在第二天上午 10 点空投前一日解冻的 ONE。空投标准为【（前一天【社区部分】ONE的解冻数量）/ 51*49】的 ONE，并按持有 BIG 比例，等比例空投给 BIG 持有者账户。\r\n\r\n\r\n【BigONE 温馨提示】\r\n\r\nBIG Token 将不继续回购、销毁。\r\n\r\nONE 为 BigONE 平台通用积分，未在其他平台流通。\r\n\r\n数字资产价格波动大，交易风险高。请您理性判断并结合自身能力审慎做出交易决策。","twitter_screen_name":"BigONEexchange","facebook_username":"exBigONE","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4960/small/Screenshot_39.png?1561103318","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"13.813","developer_score":"0","community_score":"14.899","liquidity_score":"37.301","public_interest_score":"26.281","total_supply":"13508522147","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

OPT can also track and trace the entire logistics process to ensure responsibility to each person and seamless delivery on every handoff. It provides a simple, low-cost, high-efficiency, safe and reliable blockchain solution for the entire logistics industry.\r\n\r\nOPT is based on EOS as underlying technology, but it provides independent infrastructure resources, such as computing power, bandwidth and storage, and can reduce resource costs. At the same time, it offers JS as a development language to lower the learning and development thresholds. OPT provides a self-developed set of low-cost and fast databases, which provides standard SQL and API interfaces for the application layer. OPT offers a standardized DAPP development engine for the logistics industry, which modularizes application components and enables the rapid development of DAPPs. Based on the Bancor Protocol, OPT achieves the functions of token issuance, trading, and exchange.\r\n\r\nOPT adopts a layered technical architecture, which consists of an access layer, storage layer, blockchain layer, consensus layer, interface layer and application layer. Tasked with promoting intelligent logistics, OPT utilizes blockchain technology to break information silo in the logistics industry and maximize data mobility and value. At the same time, it also adopts encryption and authorization technologies to ensure data security and privacy. By fully leveraging the value of blockchain, OPT can improve the efficiency and reduce the threshold of the whole industry. In addition, by breaking information silo and achieving data mobility, it enables better division of labor and cooperation in the logistics industry. For example, insurance, loan, finance, strategic consultation, and other third-party services will all benefit from data sharing.

Many smart and good people have become victims of corporate restructures, biased decision-making or been unfairly treated.

At the same time, Human Resources teams often don’t play an active role in managing employees. The HR function has become overworked, compliance-driven and too focused on talent acquisition – not employee development and people management. Today, user data cannot be taken for granted due to the scandals we read in the papers. HR performance data is kept by your company and you should own it but don't.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeoplewave was created to fix this.\r\n\r\nLaunched in Singapore with a simple goal, to put people first in people management. We do this by championing transparency and data-driven decision-making through our onboarding, performance review and employee analytics products.

Thus primecoin network is energy-multiuse, compared to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> network. Primecoin is designed to sustain a prosperous mining market and high level of security, while maintaining good scarcity property like gold. Primecoin also processes payment transactions 10x faster than bitcoin network.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Primecoin presents itself as an extremely interesting experiment; for the first time, we have a currency whose mining algorithm has a secondary value, and at the same time Primecoin, unlike so many other coins before it, actually makes serious attempts to improve on Bitcoin in unrelated aspects. Not taking into account Bitcoin’s massive headstart, Primecoin may well be the first alternative coin to actually be better than Bitcoin, giving the currency the potential for a bright future ahead.","twitter_screen_name":"primecoin","facebook_username":"primecoin","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"251850","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/primecoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13/small/primecoin.png?1547033632","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1373155200000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"45.159","developer_score":"67.283","community_score":"36.921","liquidity_score":"21.052","public_interest_score":"30.861","total_supply":"0","circulating_supply":"25381219","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network’s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it’s a grand-slam idea.\r\n\r\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\r\n\r\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\r\n\r\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they’re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\"","twitter_screen_name":"PundiXLabs","facebook_username":"pundixlabs","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2212228","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PundiX/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2170/small/pundi-x.png?1548386366","country_origin":"ID","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1520467200000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"37.917","developer_score":"0","community_score":"45.876","liquidity_score":"44.364","public_interest_score":"29.015","total_supply":"266962422906","circulating_supply":"238713907774.41507","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\r\n\r\nQASH is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">ERC20</a> token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">Ripple XRP token</a>. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> specializing in alternative coins or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini\">Gemini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gdax\">Coinbase</a> focusing on fiat to crypto conversions. \r\n\r\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA). The Liquid platform is actually the result of combining two previous platforms, Quoinex and Qryptos. At one time, those two trading platforms were performing over $12 billion of transactions each year.","twitter_screen_name":"quoine_SG","facebook_username":"QUOINE.SG","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2256844","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/QASH","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1220/small/qash.jpeg?1547035247","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1507593600000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"26.288","developer_score":"0","community_score":"14.066","liquidity_score":"31.131","public_interest_score":"28.742","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"354526971.373219","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable solution for the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThere are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in union with any ERC-20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany’s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen.

We have multiple development projects already running, such as Cocobay Danang and Marine City in Vietnam, and we are offering the world's first real estate pre-IPO blockchain offering before the fund lists on the New York Stock Exchange. For transparency, all of our contracts are posted on our website. \r\n\r\nRelex is a blockchain based funding vehicle creation of the parent company Squawk Advisors Inc. Squawk Advisors has an FDI development portfolio across multiple countries in the world. The Squawk group of companies has been contracting with FDI projects since 2014, and this Fall 2017, we are bringing our offerings onto the blockchain, such as Cocobay Danang, with its iconic tower seen here.\r\n\r\nRelex is the world's first cryptocurrency based real estate developer opportunity. RLX holders have the opportunity to invest in projects during the development phase, which results in exciting opportunities such as proxy ownership of resorts, shopping malls, offices, and more. And gain more rights as a proxy developer, having your voice heard regarding design and implementation of the final master plan.\r\n\r\nThere is now a better way to access yield, while retaining your standards for high transparency and high accountability for your investable capital. Introducing Relex, the world's first real estate development focused cryptocurrency, designed to provide better and simplified access for investors to high-yield projects around the world, while qualifying real estate projects to a higher level of transparency in order to be eligible for institutional capital consideration. We support projects in both developed and developing markets that strive to set the bar higher in the interest of project integrity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jones Lang Lasalle's Global Real Estate Transparency Index 2016, almost 75% of global capital invested in commercial real estate is in the Top 10 most transparent countries in the world. That means that projects in countries with low transparency scores are considered ineligible projects for investment. What if transparency scores in projects located in developing countries were improved, upgrading these projects and making them eligible for a wider stream of capital consideration? Relex is solving this problem by increasing transparency and accountability standards for real estate development projects in developing nations with low transparency scores, and aligns itself with projects that are committed to transparency, integrity, and accountability in their real estate projects. With Relex, the projects that we partner with agree to fund their development projects on the Relex blockchain, and agree to a more strict line of transparency and accountability standards.\r\n\r\nIn turn, projects on the Relex blockchain get an increased transparency and accountability score, and become eligible for a wider stream of investable capital into their projects. This is a win-win situation for both the investor and the project owners, in which there is better capital access, and better access to real estate development projects with a high degree of yield.","twitter_screen_name":"RelexTalk","facebook_username":"RelexTalk","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2075473","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RelexRLX/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1799/small/relex.jpg?1547036103","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"22.005","developer_score":"0","community_score":"31.61","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"41.148","total_supply":"2000000000","circulating_supply":"1632897890","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Simple Token is that solution.Simple Token enables all types of businesses to tokenize their assets. It empowers mainstream apps to have their own branded tokens, helping them set up their own crypto based economy on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network.\r\n\r\nThe Simple Token website lists over 35 people as part of its team, with other sections listing even more people as it advisors and extended team. Jason Goldberg is the CEO, with an 18 year career and experience in multiple countries and sectors. He is assisted by Sunil Khedar at the CTO position, and Ben Bollen as the Chief Blockchain Strategist. The team is well recognised by the investor community and markets in general. This is easy to see when you observe that it is backed by multiple VCs, including 500Startups, Greycroft, and China’s Tencent among others.\r\n\r\nOST is the future of business tokenization, allowing companies to have their own branded tokens without the costs of setting up a blockchain infrastructure. Faster transaction times, since transactions are run on their own side chains rather than the Ethereum Main Net, avoiding the Ethereum network congestion.\r\n\r\nWith the team providing monthly updates, it’s evident there is still a lot of work to be done. The ostKIT alpha is close to being released, and serves as the first public version of the complete blockchain toolkit for businesses. ostKYC is already live, and uses the OST token for all billing purposes. Other tools currently in development include a block explorer and an enterprise-grade email marketing solution. There’s also the consumer-oriented wallet to keep an eye on, as well as an updated version of the Simple Token protocol itself.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/ost-token/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of OST.","twitter_screen_name":"OSTdotcom","facebook_username":"OST","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2266379","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OSTdotcom/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1367/small/ost.jpg?1547035393","country_origin":"HK","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1510272000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"46.275","developer_score":"59.276","community_score":"36.474","liquidity_score":"27.319","public_interest_score":"42.464","total_supply":"800000000","circulating_supply":"649801645.2209308","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there’s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let’s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that’s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He’s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.","twitter_screen_name":"singularity_net","facebook_username":"singularityNET.io","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2491147","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetsub/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2138/small/singularitynet.png?1548609559","country_origin":"CH","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1513814400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"46.307","developer_score":"68.769","community_score":"26.943","liquidity_score":"33.506","public_interest_score":"26.654","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"671265290.0710626","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Developed by early contributors to both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Skycoin’s platform is completely secure, infinitely scalable, and ISP independent. It uses its own specific distributed consensus algorithm, called Obelisk, instead of other commonly used algorithms like proof of work (POW) and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake (POS)</a>. Obelisk uses the concept of ‘web of trust dynamics’ which distributes influence over the network and makes consensus decisions depending upon the influence score of each node. Each node subscribes to a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node’s network of subscribers determines its influence on the network.\r\n\r\nSkycoin is very fast. With transaction speeds close to 2 seconds and no transaction fees it can rival any other cryptocurrency on the market as a payment method. The transaction costs of Skycoin are covered by Coin Hours. This is value paid to Skycoin holders for each hour they hold a Skycoin. Skycoin is against charging transaction costs and mining incentives as it only drives up the costs of the network. The biggest benefit of Skycoin is that it is energy efficient due to the Web-of-Trust social proof. It can even run on a 30-watt cell phone processor making it great for mobile payments. Centralization becomes less of an issue when anyone can participate in the blockchain. Sia stores tiny pieces of your files on dozens of nodes across the globe. This eliminates any single point of failure and ensures highest possible uptime, on par with other cloud storage providers.\r\n\r\nA major goal of Skycoin is to promote actual usage of cryptocurrency rather than speculation. Skywire, the flagship application of Skycoin, has the ambitious goal of decentralizing the internet at the hardware level and is about to begin the testnet in April. However, this is just one of the many facets of the Skycoin ecosystem. Skywire will not only provide decentralized bandwidth but also storage and computation, completing the holy trinity of commodities essential for the new internet.\r\n\r\nSkycoin also has its own ICO platform called Fiber, their own deterministic programming language, CX, derived from Golang, a private decentralized messenger system called Sky-Messenger, and a decentralized social media platform, BBS.\r\n\r\nHere is another way to think of Skycoin: An open-source, community-owned, hardware-based peer to peer internet designed from first principles and leveraging the incentive system of the blockchain.","twitter_screen_name":"Skycoinproject","facebook_username":"skycoinproject","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"380441","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/skycoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/687/small/skycoin.png?1551071121","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1427932800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"52.969","developer_score":"81.409","community_score":"41.084","liquidity_score":"31.766","public_interest_score":"29.303","total_supply":"100000000","circulating_supply":"15000000","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

As avid supporters of cryptocurrencies, we realize that cryptocurrency adoption for the purchase of goods and services online has been slow. While there are many merchants that are beginning to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, consumers are reluctant to spend their cryptocurrency. The primary reason for this is the lack of trust. Once a cryptocurrency transaction has been made and payment is sent from the buyer to the seller, there is very little protection or recourse for the buyer in the event of a fraudulent transaction, which creates reluctance. Unlike using credit cards, which provide full buyer protection as banks can reverse a fraudulent transaction, there is no such intermediary for cryptocurrencies. In another example, Paypal has been able to succeed at a large scale due to its popular buyer protection service. Buyers on eBay can shop worry-free, knowing that they can file a claim with Paypal, who serves as the mediator in the case of a dispute.\r\n\r\nSparks is aiming to be the leading cryptocurrency platform in eCommerce. Sparks will be the first cryptocurrency platform that incorporates a buyer protection service. This process will largely be automated and fully utilize features already available within the Sparks core code. Not only will holders of Sparks be protected when spending their SPK, the Sparks platform will be made available to retailers all over the world as a service. Using the service will require subscription payments to be made in the form of SPK, creating utility and demand for the coin.

Steem aims to provide various services to its members such as a source of curated news, Q&A, job boards etc. The founders of Steem came from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitshares\">BitShares</a> with Dan Larimer involved as well.\r\n\r\nSteem’s main platform, called Steemit, is a social media network built on top of the Steem blockchain. Steemit is similar to popular content-driven social networks like Reddit and Medium, but it rewards users with cryptocurrency for their participation. Fundamentally, the more value a particular piece of content provides to a greater number of people, the more the individuals responsible for creating and curating that content can earn.\r\n\r\nUsers cast votes, creating a hierarchy of content. The more upvotes a post gets, the more it will earn. The platform also allows for downvotes, giving participants more flexibility when it comes to rating content. Steemit is meritocratic, meaning users that hold more currency can cast votes with greater influence.\r\n\r\nThe Steemit community even has another service to offer to its customers. D.tube, which is considered to be very similar to YouTube, is Blockchain based and the users can realize the difference between the traditional video publishing websites and D.tube, as the amount of money earned is also displayed beside the post apart from likes shares and comments.

CEO, and co-founder, Simon Yu, evolved this digital currency from an app called BitMaker, he and co-founder, Calvin Hsieh, worked on in 2014. BitMaker allowed users to send money without transaction fees which was the main reason this app experienced high growth volumes. A new feature called BitTask was introduced which allowed users to trade their time and effort for trying out new products in exchange for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum. This feature is now the STORM Play App and has experienced massive growth since its launch in Feb 2017.\r\n\r\nThe vision the founders have for STORM is beyond just an ordinary Cryptocurrency. They aim to create a marketplace for decentralized marketplace for tasks which will be called the “Storm Market”. “The Storm Market will operate similar to the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store in that it will serve as a platform where Storm Makers and Storm Players can create and accept tasks using smart contracts powered and paid for with STORM tokens.” The team is confident of the success of the app as it strongly relies on the give and takes model. By completing relatively easy and enjoyable tasks, users can potentially earn quite a bit of STORM, Ethereum or even Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nStorm Market is targeting the freelancing industry around micro-tasks. Currently, there are identified competitors in the market like Upwork, Mechanical Turk, etc. which are circulating huge amount of money through their platform with existing inefficiencies that ultimately creates hurdles for the freelancers. They deduct huge amount from their users earning by charging 40% of transaction cost.  The Storm market is striving to resolve the problems by providing following benefits, such as as compared to traditional micro-task marketplaces, they will charge reduce transaction fees. Besides, they Eliminate the interruption of any middlemen between buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\nStorm Market is a gamified micro-task marketplace that enables users to earn by completing different tasks. The company is expanding its platform by creating decentralized storm market by incorporating blockchain technology. In storm market, people can use their skills and talents to accomplish various tasks and get good rewards for it in the form of tokens. In short, a company is aiming to operate decentralized platform where anyone can offer or engage in tasks by utilizing blockchain based smart contracts supported by tokens (ERC-20).\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/storm-token/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Storm Token.","twitter_screen_name":"Storm_Token","facebook_username":"stormtoken","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2006999","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stormtoken","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1369/small/storm.png?1548611119","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1509926400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"44.133","developer_score":"39.013","community_score":"43.467","liquidity_score":"32.749","public_interest_score":"41.088","total_supply":"10000000000","circulating_supply":"6233699550.362669","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

{"_id":"verge","homepage":["http://vergecurrency.com/"],"blockchain_site":["https://verge-blockchain.info/","https://xvg.tokenview.com/"],"github":["https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge"],"bitbucket":[],"description":"Verge coin started its cryptocurrency journey in 2014, going by the name of DogecoinDark. The reason it was created was to create a truly private cryptocurrency. The founder of Verge felt that <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> wasn’t anonymous, so he decided to build a new blockchain where transactions could not be traced. Verge uses multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of the users are fully obfuscated. The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration as well as SSL encryption which adds an extra level of security.\r\n\r\nVerge is an open source project with an active team of developers from all over the world. The development team is always in close contact with the community. Verge is not a private company funded through an ICO or premining. Wraith Protocol is a technology upgrade package that enables our users to be able to send and receive payments privately across our blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services.   Additionally this update removes our QT wallet users off of clearnet and migrates everyone to SSL enabled Tor.\r\n\r\nVerge focuses on security and maintaining user anonymity just like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\">Monero</a>; so that is its latent upside. Many investors are also applauding its unique technology. Having been improved and integrated with the Wraith Protocol technology, verge users are now able to effortlessly switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.\r\n\r\nBefore this, private and public ledgers were mutually selected, meaning that they could not co-exist on a very similar blockchain. But investors are today free to use whatever ledger they want. A good example was when Wraith Protocol switched ON – one will not be able to view the transaction data, not even via the blockchain explorer. Additionally, Verge makes obscure the IP addresses in both instances. When coupled with Wraith Protocol Verge certainly becomes the only undetectable cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, transaction speed on Verge is light speed at 5 seconds only, using Simple Payment Verification technology. Verge also maintains a community feel since it’s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nVerges offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining. They include; Lyra2rev2, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt&view=market\">Scrypt</a>, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl. Offering a choice of five different algorithms promotes inclusion, since a wider variety of users will now have an opportunity to not only mine but influence the network. Should one algorithm demand greater mining resources, users get an option of just switching to a different one.","twitter_screen_name":"vergecurrency","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1365894","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/203/small/verge-symbol-color_logo.png?1561543281","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1412812800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"58.723","developer_score":"75.2","community_score":"58.701","liquidity_score":"36.141","public_interest_score":"37.034","total_supply":"16555000000","circulating_supply":"15808346289.1206","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Other highlights include the fact that it makes use of a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake)</a> consensus mechanism, that it generates a new block every ten seconds, and that it uses eleven voting nodes. According to the team behind the Hong Kong-based project, the network is also capable of handling 1000+ transactions per second. The platform’s main goal is to offer users a stable and secure gambling environment. \r\n\r\nWaykiChain uses a DPoS consensus mechanism with eleven accounting nodes. The annual rate of return is 5% for the first year, with a 1% increase with every year that goes by. Each time a block is created, an accounting node is randomly associated. The accounting node gains all of the transaction fees in its accounting block. Users can earn interest by locking WaykiChain coins. The interest is automatically determined each time the votes for the corresponding user account change. The terms of betting are triggered by the initiator through smart contract transactions. Users can initiate various betting contract transactions, all of which can be searched and identified in the block browsers. \r\n\r\nEven though it’s not a very popular project in the crypto space at the current moment, WaykiChain has the potential to expand its reach and spark the interest of people due to its decentralized gambling platform. The timing is also a very fortunate one, as the team seems to have everything in place before the start of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The project has a powerful dApp associated with its name. The WaykiChain Betting provides its users with real-time betting possibilities, in a transparent and open way. All the betting data is public, searchable, well organized, and cannot be changed or affected by any third-party interests. Any potential illegal actions can be, therefore, easily discovered.","twitter_screen_name":"wayki_chain","facebook_username":"waykichainofficial","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2667633","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2439/small/WaykiChain.png?1561705992","country_origin":"CN","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"43.22","developer_score":"71.324","community_score":"16.867","liquidity_score":"38.854","public_interest_score":"27.992","total_supply":"210000000","circulating_supply":"3741069.47053807","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Wowoo provides various user-friendly services on the Wowoo Platform and forms the Wowoo virtual community and sustainable ecosystem. The medium as a lubricant is the Wowoo Token itself, and that is Wowbit (WWB) being issued this time as the first Wowoo Token. WWB is scheduled to be issued on the NEO blockchain.\r\n\r\nWowoo is a virtual ecosystem, which is consisted of Wowoo Platform as the core service, Wowoo Tokens as proprietary crypto-assets that supports the ecosystem, and Wowoo System as the computer infrastructure. Wowoo platform is a virtual service foundation, which is designed to create value towards inspiring contents. Wowers and Wowees of the platform can represent their gratitude in forms of crypto-assets and Wowoo Tokens. Wowoo system administrates the generation of wowoo Tokens and controls multiple functions of Wowoo Platform, including related products and its users. This system generates all Wowoo Tokens including the series of WowBit.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Wowoo\r\nWowoo platform is designed as a virtual service foundation, which enable to create value towards inspiring events. The service foundation will be built on NEO’s platform, to accelerate the smart economy and acquire fast and secure transactions within each community that our service is used in.\r\n\r\nWowoo Wallet\r\nWowoo Wallet were developed for its users to casually and securely manage variety of tokens inside their smartphones. Using Wowoo Wallet, users will be able to store and manage over 100 types of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitcoinCash, etc., without entrusting any third parties for its care within their mobile devices.\r\n\r\nWowBit (WWB) is the first token generated by the Wowoo System, and are distributed in this token sale. In order to achieve the decentralized ecosystem, the framework of Wowoo has the following three features;\r\n\r\n1. Applicable – designable rights by Smart-Active-Control (SAC)\r\nThe biggest feature of Wowoo Token issued by Wowoo platform is the applicability of the design of inherent rights in Wowoo Token and its derivative new token. It is possible to design not only rights such as real estate with economic value but also voting rights of popularity vote. Escrow settlement in commercial transactions is also possible. Token Sale users who use the Wowoo platform can easily include their industry characteristics and design intent. However, in order to maintain soundness the design requires review and approval by the Wowoo Council (\"Counsil”).\r\n\r\n2. Stabilized – Reserve System\r\nThe Wowoo stores reserves to conserve the monetary value of Wowoo Token. We will save the minimum reserves by the Base Cryptocurrency at a certain conversion rate (“CR”) to stabilise the monetary value. In case of the WowBit, the default CR is 20%. The Wowoo Operator always operates new WowBit issue volume so that the reserved value of the Base Cryptocurrency is kept 20% of the total value of WowBit. This system allows maintaining the equivalent and fair balance between buyer and seller.\r\n\r\n3. Autonomous – Special Resolution\r\nEven if we design a perfect token, we might be forced to revise the fundamental rules someday in the future. It might be a revision of the issue amount upper limit of Wowoo Tokens or a revision of reserve ratio. The Wowoo Operator believes that such important agendas should be decided by the vote of the token holders, which is considered as a merit of the decentralized ecosystem. For this reason, we have inhered the special resolution function from the beginning.\r\nThe proposed agenda shall be approved by the Committee and will be passed by 2/3 of the number of votes of the respective Wowoo holders. Token Sale users generating derivative tokens using the Wowoo platform can also use this special resolution function.\r\n\r\nThese three functions will be built by developing Wowoo System, Wowoo Token and related products such as a secure Wowoo wallet.","twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4204/small/wowoo_tokenicon.png?1547039505","country_origin":"SG","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"17.107","developer_score":"0","community_score":"0","liquidity_score":"14.757","public_interest_score":"21.563","total_supply":"1111074832","circulating_supply":"422703762.1622118","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Horizen is one of the newly launched cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts because of its focus on privacy. The coin is gaining traction because of its privacy feature which is why it's also being anticipated to be Bitcoin’s great grandson. Horizon is a decentralized blockchain platform that can be used for public, private and anonymous transactions, communications, and publishing. Its total supply is 21 million ZEN. It was launched on 23rd May 2017 without any premining or an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\r\n\r\nThe ZenCash team is led by Ron Vigilione, who is the founder of ZenCash and William Wolf. It is backed by a robust team of veteran software developers which regularly posts updates. ZenCash is a hard fork from Zclassic. All holders of Zclassic coins before block 110,000 were awarded ZenCash coins as well through an airdrop in a 1:1 ratio. The team created ‘Super Nodes’ which maintained logic migration from off-server clusters to sidechains, which have better computation and storage. Super Nodes will support multiple applications like ZenGrid, ZenXchange, etc.\r\n\r\nZenCash uses a secure node system to relay data via connecting nodes and deliver it by the core protocol. They enforce strict privacy requirements and encrypt network data. The core protocol also delivers secure messages using the ZenChat service. A Domain fronting technique is used by ZenCash to conceal the endpoint of a communication. A commercial content distribution (CDN) network named ZenPub uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol to offer a secure standard web architecture for publishing documents securely. Another service named ZenHide helps mask network traffic data so that users facing regulatory or other filtering hurdles can connect to the ZenChat network without too much trouble.\r\n\r\nZEN coin is available to trade on multiple exchanges like Bittrex, Coss.Io, UPbit, Cryptopia, etc. But with the ZEN cryptocurrency being available over many exchanges, it can get difficult to get the best price for your transactions. While cryptocurrency exchanges provide you with a platform to buy or sell the ZEN cryptocurrency, CoinSwitch, the largest cryptocurrency conversion platform, comes in to help you make the right decision by providing the prices for ZEN. As of June 2018, its market capitalisation stands at $64.6 Million USD. The maximum supply of the ZenCash cryptocurrency (ZEN) is 21 million ZEN.\r\n\r\nZenCash is a true leader not only in privacy but with governance, economic incentives and sheer engineering ingenuity. Zen is the first ever Cryptocurrency to build in TLS. It protects not only the protocol but also the data packets sent between communications. Their secure node system allows a low barrier to entry, passive income stream for node operators. They serve the network by enforcing strict privacy requirements, maintaining full histories, and encrypting network data.\"","twitter_screen_name":"horizenglobal","facebook_username":"zencash","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2047435","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Horizen","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/691/small/horizen.png?1555052241","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"51.337","developer_score":"73.17","community_score":"38.325","liquidity_score":"34.624","public_interest_score":"27.49","total_supply":"21000000","circulating_supply":"6830900","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Multi-hash mining creates robust incentives for miners to deliver efficient, reliable security.Zen smart contracts are written and secured by a subset of the F* functional programming language, allowing users to: A) Prove the amount of resources a contract will consume and provide the necessary fees for running the contract to miners, removing the need for a “gas” based system.B) Prove their contracts meet a given specification, meaning they can prove the contract will definitely do (or not do) something given a specific set of parameters.The Zen platform comes with a built-in solution for oracles, which provide contracts with useful real world data.Finally, Zen is integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing contracts to observe and respond to native bitcoin transactions","twitter_screen_name":"zen_protocol","facebook_username":"thezenprotocol","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2419093","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1800/small/zen.png?1547036105","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"27.393","developer_score":"34.717","community_score":"15.09","liquidity_score":"0.868","public_interest_score":"27.601","total_supply":"100000000","circulating_supply":"26773050","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

BINGO has been recommended by many experts in the blockchain industry, including but not limited to: PATRICK DAI (SHUAI CHU) - Co-Founder of QTUM; Dr. Ma Zhao F. - Postdoctor of Tsinghua University, IEEE Member, ACM member, the lead of the blockchain technology team in Beijing, China. As the technology consultant for BINGO, Mob Arts is invested by China’s IT industry giant TENCENT and has the million-dollar experience in APP developing and publishing, NEXON has been authorized to publish one of their star products and received huge success. What’s more, BINGO also developed the first Crypto-currency game with specific game play QTUM HEROES together with QTUM, and thus starts their deep cooperation era.\r\n\r\nBiNGO is the first pan-entertainment platform to operate on a blockchain. It applies decentralization principles to heavy user aggregation and gameplayer communications, creating a new generation of entertainment platforms. The project is composed of a Customer Management System, the BiNGO Wallet, a Traffic Exchange System, a Decentralized Data Analysis System, and the BiNGO Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe success of the BiNGO Platform will be dependent on offering users a wide range of world-class games and entertainment. MobArts, as technical partner and an award-winning game publisher, has a history of releasing top-tier games that have been downloaded more than a hundred million of times and consistently ranked in the top 10 on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store.\r\n\r\nBingo is essentially a game store, much like the App Store or Google Play. However, instead of using traditional currencies, it uses a coin native to the Bingo ecosystem called 777 that can be securely stored in, or traded between, Bingo wallets. All that is needed for game development, publishing, or for making game payments are the Bingo platform and the Bingo wallet.BINGO promises to offer game publishers and developers low barriers to entry, fair and fast access to a wide market of players, and the ability to quickly and easily monetize their offerings. In addition to all of the above, the Bingo ecosystem is working to combine social, advertising, analytics, and other modules to offer all users a truly comprehensive, pan-entertainment system that caters to all their needs.\r\n\r\nThis specific market segment is one that is expected to grow substantially in the years to come. With blockchain technologies promising to bring about a revolution in the way we do everything, Bingo, with a talented tech team behind it and a game industry visionary at the helm, is poised to completely redefine online games.","twitter_screen_name":"Bingo_Platform","facebook_username":"777BingoPlatform","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"3069984","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3802/small/777-bingo-logo.jpg?1547038880","country_origin":"HK","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"5.829","developer_score":"0","community_score":"12.111","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"26.009","total_supply":"10000000000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

What is ABCC Token?\r\n\r\nABCC Token (AT) is an ERC20 Token to be issued by ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. The total supply of AT is fixed at 210 million without any future offering.\r\n\r\n2. Benefits of AT\r\n\r\nAT is a blockchain-based token native to ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. Members holding AT will be able to get access to a wide range of benefits including but not limited to—\r\n\r\nUsing AT for various products and services on ABCC. For example, members can purchase other digital assets, pay transaction fees and gain preferential access to premium services with AT. \r\nParticipating in various activities and campaigns on ABCC. ABCC will reward members who meet certain criteria. For example, members holding AT will share in 80% of trading commissions collected by ABCC.\r\nParticipating in various activities such as community building, interaction between members and ABCC, proposing suggestions to ABCC and others. \r\n3. Initial Allocation\r\n\r\nBelow is a breakdown of the initial allocation of AT.\r\n\r\n4. Issuance\r\n\r\nWe will adopt a mechanism called “Trade Contribution + Simultaneous Release” to issue AT.\r\n\r\n4.1 Trade Contribution\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT. \r\n\r\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\r\n\r\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the “Trade-to-Mine” (ToM) mechanism.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., “release” and “distribution”. \r\n\r\nRelease\r\n\r\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on. Please see details of AT release schedule below. \r\n\r\nWithin each half-life period, one “block” will be generated every 6 hours. The same number of AT will be released for every block inside the same half-life period. For example, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period is calculated as follows.\r\n\r\nThe total number of AT in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000;\r\nThe number of days in the 1st half-life period: 120 days;\r\nOne block will be generated every 6 hours;\r\nThe number of blocks to be generated every day: 24 hours / 6 hours = 4;\r\nTherefore, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000/120 / (24 hours / 6 hours) = 87,500.\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nWe will distribute AT released in a block to members per the percentage of their trading fees within that block.\r\n\r\nIf it so happens that there are no members eligible for the rewards in a certain block, the released AT assigned to this block will be distributed in the next block.\r\n\r\n4.1.2 Reward for Historical Trades\r\n\r\n10% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward eligible existing users.  We will distribute the rewards to the eligible users based on their cumulative trade volume contribution ending 24:00 June 27th, 2018 (UTC+8). The rewards will be frozen for 180 days after the launch of AT.\r\n\r\n4.2 Simultaneous Release\r\n\r\nAT will be released to the platform, team and investors in proportion to the number of AT released and distributed to members via Trade-to-Mine (ToM).\r\n\r\nThe number of AT released via Simultaneous Release = the number of AT released and distributed via ToM * (50% / 40%).","twitter_screen_name":"ABCC_Exchange","facebook_username":"ABCC-Exchange-558472047871367","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5132/small/abcc-token.png?1547040523","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"26.151","developer_score":"0","community_score":"17.204","liquidity_score":"37.97","public_interest_score":"29.4","total_supply":"146015625","circulating_supply":"45671975","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The ideas include decentralization and populism, which represent people's demands for the return of certain rights and a more equitable, flattened world. The technologies include blockchains, artificial intelligence (AI), and the internet of things (IoT), none of which work independently. These technologies need to work together to allow for industrial applications and business work-flows to be restructured and reach new horizons.\r\n\r\nIn response to these changes and trends, ABO, based on its in-depth research and analysis in the medical care industry, plans to bring about the return of medical data ownership and management rights by taking advantage of distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, ABO will promote the credibility and inter-operability of medical devices and enhance the st andardization of medical data. In this way, a secure, highly efficient, and cross-system data sharing system will be created.

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency. Except that it now comes secured by a multi-sig authentication system that prevents any type of security breach. According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot’s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\r\n\r\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020. This would encourage it to embed new features on its platform.\r\nWith the help of multi-app functionality and block technology, the company envisions to have an “airline in the pocket” of sorts within two years. While its price has fluctuated like most other cryptocurrencies, it delivered more than 15x returns within a short period between November 2017 to January 2018. As of July 2018, the price is nearly back to its November levels, at $0.57.","twitter_screen_name":"aeron_aero","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2078239","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/aeronaero","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1124/small/aeron.png?1547035116","country_origin":"BZ","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1509667200000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"35.279","developer_score":"33.698","community_score":"17.598","liquidity_score":"37.907","public_interest_score":"26.665","total_supply":"20000000","circulating_supply":"20000000","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications. \r\n\r\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The “AppCoin” ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\r\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\r\n\r\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\r\n\r\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins’ solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them. However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.","twitter_screen_name":"AppCoinsProject","facebook_username":"AppCoinsOfficial","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2280664","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppcoinsProtocol","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1876/small/appcoins.png?1547036186","country_origin":"SG","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1509926400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"42.992","developer_score":"48.549","community_score":"41.733","liquidity_score":"27.157","public_interest_score":"27.22","total_supply":"246203093","circulating_supply":"108454021.71615385","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

{"_id":"ardor","homepage":["https://www.ardorplatform.org/"],"blockchain_site":["https://ardor.tools/"],"github":[],"bitbucket":["https://bitbucket.org/Jelurida/ardor"],"description":"Ardor is the latest in the growing field of contenders for blockchain as a service (BaaS) providers. Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. The developers of Ardor are the same company behind the open source <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nxt>Nxt project</a> that also aimed to democratize access to blockchain technology. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.\r\n\r\nNxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren’t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you’ve created a new currency that’s independent of Nxt, you’ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. This is also true for currencies that use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum’s</a> ERC20 protocol to build on top of the Ethereum blockchain. They pay fees in Ether.\r\n\r\nTo test Ardor’s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\">Ignis</a> ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor’s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.\r\n\r\nArdor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.","twitter_screen_name":"ArdorPlatform","facebook_username":"ardorplatform","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1518497","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ardor/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/525/small/Ardor.png?1557969103","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1514764800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"37.629","developer_score":"11.164","community_score":"43.773","liquidity_score":"34.347","public_interest_score":"27.972","total_supply":"998999495","circulating_supply":"998999495","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

That is exactly what happened with our project – Balkan coin. We are a group of developers, marketing workers and web developers from the Balkans, which were dedicated to this idea several years ago, but the final realization came at the end of 2017, which on the other hand proved to be a boom year for all other crypto currencies, especially for the Bitcoin, ethereum monero etc.\r\n\r\nIn the background of this idea, the need of a sophisticated way to connect all people who originate from this part of the world – the Balkan Peninsula, was dragged as a thread. As most people know, the Balkans is a region which is located in the southeastern part of Europe and which in the past was the center of world’s greatest interests, starting with the Crusades, the Balkan Wars, World War I and World War II. The oldest crossroads in the mankind history pass through the Balkan, it is the cradle of the oldest civilizations, and of course, there are many great names that origin from this peninsula, such as Alexander the Great and Nikola Tesla. As a geographical area with such turbulent and significant history, the Balkan has left a trace in the genes of all people who originate from this part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan man is probably a combination of the most controversial features of every person (hospitality, cordiality, friendliness, hard work, but also selfishness, belligerence, enraged, vulgarity, low self-esteem etc.). The countries that gravitate in this region are almost without exception led by incompetent people whose only goal in life is to get rich on the back of the citizens, disregarding the basic human freedom and the right of each individual, and that is perhaps the karma of this region remaining from the past.\r\n\r\nA man who originates from the Balkan, who possesses these features, can easily adapt to any living conditions in different geographical areas. Therefore, the number of people of this part of the world who are looking for better future is huge, so they quite often decide to leave their homes and seek their existence in other more prosperous countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Balkan man is emotionally attached and committed to his family. He always tries to find a way to help his loved ones who still live in the countries of this region. Tens of billions of dollars are sent each year from “our” people from the more economically developed countries to their close relatives and friends. They have a significant role in reducing the deficit in the economy in almost all Balkan countries through foreign exchange remittance. For example, in Macedonia only, these remittances are approximately 1 billion dollars. All the transactions are carried out through banks or through fast money transfer services. Both of them are quite slow and burdened by large commissions that end up in the bank accounts.\r\n\r\nHaving this in mind, our idea was born – Balkancoin. Every person from any place on the globe, even broader if it has internet connection, can send a value personified in Balkan coins to any person in the Balkan and anywhere in world (in fact, this is the main goal of the crypto-currency).","twitter_screen_name":"BalkancoinAdmin","facebook_username":"Balkancoin","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2821734","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4199/small/balkancoin_512x512.png?1547039495","country_origin":null,"genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"16.092","developer_score":"12","community_score":"11.668","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"32.656","total_supply":"690000000","circulating_supply":"118521987.37033","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The initiators of the project have set a goal — to decentralize the process of business expansion and take it beyond the framework of traditional partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe Bananacoin Project will facilitate wider recognition of blockchain technology on the commodity market, forming a close connection with blockchain communities — Bitcoin, Ethereum, WAVES and others. Bananacoin will create tokens using blockchain (Ethereum), and tokens will be emitted based on the export price of 1 kilogram of bananas.\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nBananacoin is blockchain project aiming to achieve a core modification of the global banana production industry, similar to how Uber has revolutionized the taxi industry or how Upwork has brought freelancing to a new level. In short, the initiators of the project create processes in the production of organic bananas through the implementation of an economic element in the seemingly completely understood export relations of the product.\r\n\r\nBananacoin is using the proven TGE crowdfunding model, allowing backers to invest in expansion of production and become holders of Bananacoin tokens (BCO), which can be exchanged after project launch for goods or funds and are expected to more than double in value in 18 months’ time. \r\n\r\nAfter the realisation of the project, Bananacoin tokens will be exchangeable for a certain amount of Lady Finger bananas or equivalent monetary compensation. Because the token is backed by the market value of 1 kilogram of bananas, participants can be certain of the success of the project, as the demand for bananas is constant. Furthermore, Lady Finger bananas are considered to be among the best banana varieties, and the environmentally friendly technologies used in our project ensure that the good will remain an attractive investment and that its price will grow constantly","twitter_screen_name":"Bananacoin_Eng","facebook_username":"bananacoinENG","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2112748","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3709/small/25353901_371505116655449_7707345238136643950_n.png?1547038731","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"23.61","developer_score":"31.98","community_score":"13.328","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"27.038","total_supply":"6812551","circulating_supply":"6812551","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The project offers a network, which we’ll discuss soon, that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges. That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.\r\n\r\nBancor’s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn’t call for an exchange of tokens with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain’s protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert back and forth between those reserves as users request it.\r\n\r\nThe Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation that’s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos\">Tezos (XTZ)</a>. \r\n\r\nOne of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens’ built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens’ smart contracts always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible for balancing a Smart Token’s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token’s total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios, known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps.\"","twitter_screen_name":"BancorNetwork","facebook_username":"bancor","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1789222","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/736/small/bancor.png?1547034477","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1497225600000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"51.191","developer_score":"64.497","community_score":"43.766","liquidity_score":"37.373","public_interest_score":"30.672","total_supply":"75783855","circulating_supply":"68750368.32785156","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\">Bitcoin Core software</a>. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>","twitter_screen_name":"bitcoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2040221","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/780/small/bitcoin_cash.png?1547034541","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"75.229","developer_score":"70.535","community_score":"77.801","liquidity_score":"81.577","public_interest_score":"43.827","total_supply":"21000000","circulating_supply":"17878352.1469082","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

According to the founders, the Bitcoin blockchain has become too centralized. Large companies with huge banks of mining computers now mine the vast majority of Bitcoin. For the founders of Bitcoin Gold, having large companies control the Bitcoin network defeats the purpose of a decentralized ledger and peer-to-peer currencies. In response, they’ve initialized the Bitcoin Gold project. It’s an alternate fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that implements changes that make mining more equitable.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Bitcoin Gold is to create a network where anyone can become a miner with only basic hardware. As a result, Bitcoin Gold mining would be spread among many miners, instead of a few large companies.There have several features such as decentralization. Bitcoin Gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash-BTG, which cannot be run on the specialty equipment used for Bitcoin mining (ASIC miners.) This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with common GPUs. Besides, there have fair distribution. Hard forking Bitcoin’s blockchain fairly and efficiently distributes 16.5 million BTG immediately to people all over the world who have interest in cryptos. \r\n\r\nOther methods, such as creating coins with a new genesis block, concentrate ownership within a small group. There also have a replay protection. To ensure the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Gold has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses, essential features that protect users and their coins from several kinds of accidents and malicious threats. Most new mineable cryptocurrencies involve ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms, and it’s becoming something of an industry standard to promote decentralization. In that respect, Bitcoin Gold holds a lot to be excited about. At its core, it’s about transitioning the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> network to more decentralized mining.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we saw above, there’s not much evidence that the current Bitcoin mining system is broken. There have been some small complaints, and it’s not ideal that the network is so centralized. Nevertheless, miners on Bitcoin have a lot to lose if they wield their power too aggressively. There are also new entrants to the Bitcoin mining community that are decentralizing control from a few key ASIC farms. The general consensus from Bitcoin experts is there’s not enough new in Bitcoin Gold to warrant an independent investment. While it certainly doesn’t hurt to hold onto your free BTG that you receive as a result of the fork (if you owned Bitcoin before Oct 24), wait until the dust settles before deciding whether to buy more.\"","twitter_screen_name":"bitcoingold","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2284289","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1043/small/bitcoin-gold-logo.png?1547034978","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"49.314","developer_score":"65.902","community_score":"19.463","liquidity_score":"47.051","public_interest_score":"32.267","total_supply":"21000000","circulating_supply":"17513924","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It allows you to move value – according to your own rules – within a scalable, green and customizable ledger. The special proof of capacity method means “you just have to plug in your drive, plot it, and leave your computer mining and earning you coins periodically. The more space you allocate to mining, the higher the reward.” The mining will not hurt your hard drive or cause a noticeable change in your electricity bill. If you ever decide to stop mining, you can delete the information that Burstcoin plots onto the hard drive and use the space for its originally intended purpose. It also offers several other decentralized features such as asset trading and crowdfunding. You can sell digital goods in a peer-to-peer marketplace or even auction off your items. With all of the transactions you engage in on the Burst network, there’s the option of attaching messages as well.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous user introduced Burstcoin on bitcointalk.org in 2014. The coin was developed off of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nxt\">Nxt platform</a> and thus offers many of the same features. Following in the footsteps of Satoshi Nakamoto, the Burstcoin creator never revealed his identity. After the creator disappeared, the cryptocurrency community organized to continue developing the coin. A team called the Proof of Capacity Consortium is currently developing Burstcoin. Burstcoin is not just famous for its proof of capacity mining. It was the first blockchain to implement “Turing complete” smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThe most famous application of the smart contracts was a completely decentralized lottery. Estimates towards the end of 2017 calculated for each terabyte of hard drive space you commit to the network, you would mine an average of 21 Burstcoins per week. At the time, there were over 150,000 terabytes of storage devoted to the network. Estimates towards the end of 2017 calculated for each terabyte of hard drive space you commit to the network, you would mine an average of 21 Burstcoins per week. At the time, there were over 150,000 terabytes of storage devoted to the network. The online Burstcoin wallet will also walk you through how to start plotting your hard drive so that you can begin mining right away. Burst is designed to be a miner-friendly coin to ensure decentralization of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWith Bitcoin receiving criticism over wasted energy, Burst offers a more environmentally friendly way to mine and run a decentralized blockchain. If you are looking to mine cryptocurrency but were intimidated by the loud and expensive machines, you might want to check out proof of capacity and consider mining Burstcoin.

Bytecoin allows users to make absolutely anonymous money transfers through the CryptoNote algorithm. CryptoNote uses CryptoNote ring signatures to provide anonymous transactions and allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group. The signature only proves the message was created by someone from the group, but all the possible signers are indistinguishable from each other.\r\n\r\nEven if outgoing transactions are untraceable, everyone may still be able to see the payments received and thus determine one's income. By using a variation of the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, a receiver has multiple unique one-time addresses derived from his single public key. After funds are sent to these addresses they can only be redeemed by the receiver; and it would be impossible to cross-link these payments.\r\n\r\nAs a primarily peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system, Bytecoin has many of the same use-cases as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. Created in 2012, Bytecoin is one of the earliest developed cryptocurrencies. Until recently, the team behind the coin has kept themselves anonymous. Now, though, they’ve opened up multiple communication channels, removed some layers of anonymity, and even built several local communities.\r\n\r\nBitcoin’s PoW consensus algorithm heavily favors miners that use powerful GPU and ASIC machines over those trying to mine with CPUs. This causes the network to centralize around the more powerful miners. Bytecoin attempts to close the gap between these two classes of miners with a new algorithm, Egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW). Egalitarian PoW uses a version of skrypt, a proof of work function similar to the hashcash function used by Bitcoin. The difference between the two is that scrypt isn’t memory bound. Because of this, you can produce highly efficient CPU mining rigs. GPUs will always be about 10 times more effective, though.\r\n\r\nThe Bytecoin project has been fairly fractured since its inception in July 2012. Previously, several isolated teams worked on the project without seemingly communicating with each other. This led to numerous forks and versions of the coin. In July 2017, the team decided to change their image and provide more transparency to the community. The team still remains pseudo-anonymous by only providing names and headshots on their webpage – no bios or social media links. But, it’s tough to expect more from a project that’s focused on privacy. The team has been busy at work refactoring their code and are planning to release a new public API on February 6, 2018. They’ll also be entering the Asian, Middle East, and African markets throughout 2018.","twitter_screen_name":"Bytecoin_BCN","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"512747","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BytecoinBCN/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/92/small/bytecoin-logo.png?1547033763","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1341360000000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"44.264","developer_score":"44.605","community_score":"50.637","liquidity_score":"11.547","public_interest_score":"36.124","total_supply":"184470000000","circulating_supply":"184066827285.84","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The chain includes AI algorithms that support smart contracts, which means anyone can use Cortex to add AI to their smart contracts. It also creates an incentive mechanism for collective collaboration, allowing anyone to submit and optimize models in Cortex, while model contributors can also be rewarded. The end result of Cortex, according to the whitepaper, is the creation of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, “being born on the Cortex”. Cortex completed a private token sale in February/March 2018 for its CTXC tokens. That funding round was led by Bitmain and FBG Capital, among other well-known investors in the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\nPlacing artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain isn’t a straightforward process. However, Cortex will solve this problem by allowing machine learning researchers around the world to upload well-trained corresponding data models to the storage layer of the Cortex public chain. Other users who need these AI models can make inferences using the models, then pay the person who developed those models. At each inference, a full node synchronizes the model and the data from the storage tier to the local site. Making an inference using Cortex’s unique virtual machine, or CVM, will synchronize the results to the whole network and then return the result. Every time a user initiates a transaction on the Cortex, opens a smart contract, or performs an intelligence inference, the user will need to pay a certain number of “Endorphin” tokens.\r\n\r\nEndorphin is the pricing unit for transactions on Cortex. However, the platform will have two tokens, including Endorphins and Cortex Coins (CTXC). The overall goal of Cortex is to provide state-of-the-art machine learning models on the blockchain where users can infer using smart contracts. Cortex also seeks to create a machine learning platform where users can post tasks on the platform or submit artificial intelligence-based decentralized apps.\r\n\r\nCortex’s token sale began with a single private placement round. That round took place from February 7 to March 7, 2018, during which tokens were sold at a price of 1 ETH = 1500 CTXC. In March 2018, the company announced that it had reached its target cap of 40,000 ETH for 60 million CTXC, or 20.01% of the total token distribution. FBG Capital and Bitmain were lead investors during the token sale. CTXC tokens are ERC20 tokens on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. There’s a total supply of 299,792,458 tokens. Of the total supply, 50.03% (150 million) are reserved for Cortex coin miners as a mining reward, 24.95% (74,792,458) are dedicated to the project’s foundation from the genesis block (including 15.01% to the Cortex Lab, 9.01% to project marketing, and 0.93% to challenge bounties), with the remaining 5% going to advisors, academia, and the community from the genesis block.\r\nCortex aims to place advanced artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain. The company recently completed a private investment round during its token sale for CTXC tokens in February/March 2018. The next step is to roll out the Cortex public chain. Key features of the platform include its smart AI contracts and its Cortex Virtual Machine, both of which allow for advanced AI-based smart contract programming.","twitter_screen_name":"CTXCBlockchain","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cortex_Official/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3861/small/2638.png?1523930406","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"35.739","developer_score":"51.768","community_score":"38.16","liquidity_score":"45.786","public_interest_score":"40.999","total_supply":"299792458","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

We have decided to do a fork of Litecoin since it is a very versatile currency having as its main features a high speed of transaction combined with high safety.\r\n\r\nWe have not wanted to add the feature of \"Privaty Send\" since we want the currency to be used or money laundering or to buy illegal products. In other words, we want to be very transparent with the rest of the world in such a way that if there is a fraudulent act, transactions could be traced.\r\n\r\nWe will show the technical characteristics of the cryptocurrency later, but I want to talk about the project itself firstly.\r\n\r\nIn line with the birth of Davies the Daviescoin IT OÜ society, a company that is based in Estonia. Its founder Daniel García will lead the company with the help of different trusted partners (Spanish companies) which will be the ones that will run the software development of the project, marketing, communication, etc. (We will mention them later).\r\n\r\nWhat will be the function of the company Daviescoin IT OÜ and Davies?\r\n\r\nThe function that we want to give to this coin is to create a company and people network who work with Davies endowing the currency with real applications, not just merely speculative, to extend the currency around the world, and what better way to support it than with the creation of the first company that will use and promote Davies, Daviescoin IT OÜ.\r\n\r\nThe company Daviescoin IT OÜ must meet several objectives, one of them will be to show to new entrepreneurs that companies using this cryptocurrency as a base can be constructed. Daviescoin IT OÜ will filter out different projects in any area and if it considers that they are innovative and high potential projects, Daviescoin IT OÜ will finance them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another objective of this year and part of the next will be to launch an App for Android and IOS that will have the wallet function for Davies and two extras features, DaviesLoan and DaviesPay. Many of you will be wondering that what DaviesLoan and DaviesPay are, so let's make a brief introduction and then you can see many more details.\r\n\r\nDaviesPay will be a payment module that will allow us from the app to buy coins by credit card and sell them receiving the amount in the user's bank account. This module will be available on our website and we will also enable a public API so that others can integrate it into their apps or other websites. In addition, as soon as the currency is quoting, and we have the module DaviesPay finished, we will integrate the currency with Tickebit and therefore the currency could be bought in Spain even with cash in more than 5000 points.\r\n\r\nWe also want to emphasize that DaviesPay is a required module to be able to develop a subsequent DaviesLoan, a system that will also be integrated into the Davies app in order to make loans between individuals, which will be able to fix their interests and even sign a contract with a legal electronic signature in any part of the world thanks to the homologation obtained by DocuSign.\r\n\r\nAs you see, we want to give much more importance to the use of the currency than to its characteristics.\r\n\r\nUltimately our ultimate goal is to decentralize the banking sector by converting each of the world’s person into their own bank, being able to transfer money in Davies format, create loans and buy and sell Davies for other currencies according to the needs of each user, for which we have already closed an agreement with TransferWise although we will continue to open trade agreements even with physical exchange houses to be able to reach any country in the world.","twitter_screen_name":"daviescoin","facebook_username":"daviescoin.ou","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"4943583","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5668/small/logodaviesred.png?1559916938","country_origin":"EE","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"18.139","developer_score":"14.946","community_score":"14.807","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"38.443","total_supply":"100000000","circulating_supply":"12834200","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

TOR increases the amount of privacy for cryptocurrency users and reduces the possibilities of being attacked or hacked by other illegal or legal entities. With the help of DeepOnion, you can easily receive and send ONIONs (the cryptocurrency of the DeepOnion blockchain) over the TOR network. The blockchain ensures anonymity and can also be used to receive or send personal transactions with the help if Deepcoin wallet. DeepOnion has just one major goal, that is, to protect the privacy and identity of the users by making a payment platform that is secure, scalable, instantaneous, untraceable, and anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe DeepOnion coin was launched in July 2017. Its 40 rounds of airdrops, where the coins were distributed for free, helped the currency to get recognized in the market. DeepOnion has also established its partnerships with multiple privacy services such as Bisq P2P DEX, and with other online marketplaces. The blockchain uses both, Proof of Stake and Proof of Work algorithms. The TOR network powering DeepOnion ensures anonymity and security of peer-to-peer connections. There are few countries which have blocked the access to TOR browser. In order to solve this, DeepOnion had released protocols for bypassing the issue.\r\n\r\nThe Onion Routing (TOR) is a technology that is used to ensure anonymity over the internet. The messages on the ONION network are encapsulated in multiple layers of encryption, just like the layers of an onion. This encrypted data is further sent through a series of network nodes which are known as onion routers. Each of this peels away a single layer that uncovers the next destination of the data. Stealth addresses help to prevent public connection of an output of the transaction with a recipient’s wallet address. They also conceal the destination address of a transaction, thereby hiding the identity of the receiver on the network of the DeepOnion cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nOne reason that can contribute in the rise of ONION is that the coin provides 100% anonymity with TOR technology. It keeps funds of its users safe from government and hackers. The private transactions, which has also been the backlog of various other cryptocurrencies has been fulfilled by DeepOnion. Another reason that will help ONION rise is because it requires less time for making or receiving payments.\r\n\r\nEven though ONION has outstanding as well as unique features, it still has a global ranking beyond 300, which means that it still has a long way to make to the list of top cryptocurrencies. The coin is still being overlooked due to other major digital currencies.","twitter_screen_name":"GetDeepOnion","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"5122577","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepOnion","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1148/small/deeponion-circle-icon.png?1554961318","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1499904000000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"41.69","developer_score":"69.591","community_score":"34.714","liquidity_score":"3.79","public_interest_score":"27.172","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"21837378.3457589","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The mission of DigiByte is to bring the benefits of blockchain payment technology to merchants, consumers, & mainstream societies across the globe in the most easy to understand way possible. DigiBytes are digital assets that cannot be destroyed, counterfeited or hacked, making them ideal for protecting objects of value like currency, information, property or important digital data. DigiBytes can be sent over the DigiByte Blockchain and forever recorded on an immutable public ledger that is decentralized on thousands of computers across the planet. DigiByte is a decentralized digital asset and an open source based blockchain platform.\r\n\r\nDigibyte was developed by Jared Tate in 2014 who is also its lead developer. The DigiByte Blockchain is not controlled by any private company. The team regularly upgrades its system to add new features. The Digibyte team is developing a mining algorithm swap to make mining more decentralised. Its most awaited project is the “Core 4.1.3” protocol that will let users create and enter into the smart contracts on its blockchain.\r\n\r\nDigiByte has 5 advanced mining algorithms that help maintain mining decentralisation. These 5 Proof of Work algorithms split the Digibyte mining operations and mining power to facilitate secure transactions. The load on the 5 mining algorithms is rebalanced using MultiShied technology. This adjusts the difficulty of all the nodes to avoid the domination of one algorithm over another and manipulation of smaller blockchains. Segregated Witness technology provides scalability by making the ledger size more compact. It also enables cross-chain transactions and single confirmation transactions.\r\n\r\nDigibyte-based platforms include DigiByteGaming, DigibyteTip, DigiByteMarket, DiguSign, Digi-ID, and DigiHash. The core business of this is DigiByteGaming, which provides coins in connection with various games including wow, roll, kass, minecraft and so on. The coins you earn can be used in other games, or you can cash out and gain real benefits over game money. However, the current Korean Game Industry Act makes it illegal to exchange or arrange the results obtained through games, so the possibility of success of this platform in Korea may be smaller than in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nCoin feature\r\n1. Digibytes wants to reach the final issue in 2035 by reducing block compensation by 1% every month. The inflation rate in 2017 is 12%.\r\n2. Digibytes will increase the volume of transactions that the digibit network can handle by executing special code that doubles the block size every two years until 2035. Currently, 560 transactions can be handled in 1 second by 2017, and over 2,803 transactions can be processed in 1 second by 2035.\r\n3. It has evolved steadily to accommodate new functions through four hard forks and three soft forks. These include DigiShield, MultiAlgo, MultiShield, DigiSpeed, and SegWit.\r\n- Successfully implemented Segwit in April 2017. This can be seen as being ready to develop and run technologies such as lightning networks, cross-crossing transactions, and atomic swap.\r\n- DigiShield is a hard fork that shortens the duration of difficulty adjustments to check multi-pool mining, which is not difficult to mine a lot. This technique was later applied by the Digibot team to DOGGE, START COIN (START), ZAGAC (ZEC) and so on.\r\n\r\nCore Value: multi-algorithm & multi-security\r\n1. MultiAlgo: DigiByte introduced a system for hard-forking in September 2014, in which five algorithms each mined 20% of the blocks. It has the advantage of better decentralization and the ability to use various mining methods than one algorithm. The 5 algorithms are <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\">Scrypt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?hashing_algorithm=SHA-256\">SHA-256</a>, Qubit, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/skeincoin\">Skein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/groestlcoin\">Groestl</a>.\r\n\r\n2. MultiShield: Multi-security, introduced in December 2014 as a hard fork, is based on multi-algorithms. For PoW attacks to succeed, you have to control one algorithm at 93% and the remaining 4 at least 51%, so you can better defend against these attacks. In fact, because it uses technology such as the Nuclear Security Code, it provides security equivalent to five times that of other coins.","twitter_screen_name":"digibytecoin","facebook_username":"digibytecoin","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"408268","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/63/small/digibyte.png?1547033717","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1389312000000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"54.453","developer_score":"64.206","community_score":"53.189","liquidity_score":"37.382","public_interest_score":"32.087","total_supply":"21000000000","circulating_supply":"12000138138.1714","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Dogecoin is a <a href=\"/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a> fork. Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading.

The coin seems to be leading on the technology front irrespective of its market capitalisation trends, which is why it's also being anticipated to be <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum’s</a> competitor. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, where sensitive business logic and smart contract functionality is held by the owner. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol DGRN & has a total supply of 433,494,437 coins. Dragonchain uses serverless smart contracts from its pre-built library. This feature is unique to this cryptocurrency, as it can create smart contracts, with or without cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nDragonchain was developed by Joe Roets who is its CEO and Chief Architect with a team of 4 core developers. The team is backed by a strong advisory board with Jeff Garzik on board who is established icon in the Bitcoin network. It was developed after exploration of 20 use cases and applications. It was released under the Apache 2 license in October 2016 to integrate real business applications onto a blockchain, protect business data and operations, currency agnosticism and multi-currency support. The launch of Dragonchain Foundation, a non profit corporation, in January’17 maintains the ownership and responsibility of Dragonchain’s open source code.\r\n\r\nEnterprises can easily design smart contracts in a variety of languages like Python, Node, C# & Java. The contracts can be specific to their business needs to include both private internal and public blockchain interactions. The Currency Smart Contracts help organizations to retrieve and transfer specified currency amounts between wallet addresses and check balances which can be run on schemas like ERC20, ERC223, etc. Dragonchain helps enterprises to leverage their models using blockchain by allowing development and integration before the economic model is known. Monetization can be applied after sufficient real data is available & system is functioning.\r\n\r\nDragonChain’s platform is establishing a niche in the crypto world with its layered security feature. The 5-layer security model adds great credibility to their overall goal of facilitating business integration into the blockchain. Additionally, DragonChain is seen as a strong rival to Ethereum because of the platform’s ability to scale; an issue that Ethereum has been notorious for. As of January 2018, the DragonChain team is raising funds and finishing development of the platform. Although the exact date is currently unannounced, the DRGN platform is expected to fully launch sometime this year.","twitter_screen_name":"dragonchaingang","facebook_username":"dragonchaingang","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2096284","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dragonchainblockchain","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1289/small/dragonchain.png?1547957761","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1512086400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"46.689","developer_score":"64.529","community_score":"36.279","liquidity_score":"28.827","public_interest_score":"27.187","total_supply":"433494437","circulating_supply":"264145288.6847","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Emercoin inherits the reliability and security of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, while at the same time adding more features to its own blockchain by leveraging several innovative technologies. The Emercoin blockchain has been specially designed to provide businesses with the secure blockchain services and also allow them to create their own decentralized apps.\r\n\r\nEmercoin was founded in the year 2013 by Eugene Shumilov who also serves as the chief executive officer of Emercoin. The Emercoin team also consists chief technical officer Oleg Khovayko, a cryptocurrency & financial expert and Stan Polozov a Blockchain Implementation Specialist. Emercoin is also backed by a decentralized team of nine advisors from across the world.\r\n\r\nEmercoin has been in the market since 2014, and its past trend in the cryptocurrency market shows that it has followed a steady and stable growth. Emercoin has scored many partnerships. Two of its major partners are Coca Cola and Microsoft. Some other partners are RedHat, LLoyd’s, Bitfury, Aspanta, Deloitte, Authorizers, Foundico, Anteko, etc. Emercoin has also been featured on some prominent media platforms such as Forbes, Digital Trends, Engadget, The Business Times, Aljazeera, Gadgets Now and others.\r\n\r\nWith the sheer variety of services that the Emercoin platform makes available to its users, it would not be surprising to see this currency be viewed as a lucrative investment option by many novice as well as experienced investors in the near future.

Aiming to be a general-purpose smart contract platform, ETZ helps developers set up DAPPs that not limited in finance and business scope, but those more frequently used in daily life, to popularize decentralized services to more people and industries. ETZ eliminates the gas fee system from Ethereum network core and adds a Transaction Restriction Policy Protocol layer that associates the threshold, frequency, depth, etc. of initiating transactions with the account balance to combat DDOS like attacks.\r\n\r\nIn particular, ETZ also draws on DASH's two-tier network architecture built with Masternodes transaction verification network and blockchain ledger layer, and its built-in community autonomous system to provide users with real-time operation feedback and high transaction concurrency, no longer need to wait for a long transaction confirmation time. \r\n\r\nETZ picks the proven experience of Ethereum on smart contracts, removes its less scalability gas-based fee system and designs a fully accountable trading limit and security strategy against DDOS Class attacks. The final two-tier network composed of the main node and pow consensus layer laid the foundation to achieve free of charge, high concurrency, real-time transactions, independent evolution and several other features.\r\n\r\nWhat does no-fee mean to DApp Dev?\r\nTaking a simple Todolist DApp as an example, its decentralized implementation can be applied to the team task decomposition process, which requires all participants in the project to know the tasks of other members. Each task is a team consensus result with demand of traceability.\r\n\r\nThe application involves registration of members, additions, deletions and alterations of tasks. According to Ethereum development requirements, all of these operations require gas consumption, which is clearly unreasonable for the users of the application. While in EtherZero, the transaction initiation frequency and the execution depth of smart contracts will be positively related to the balance possessed by the account. This mechanism is similar to POS, it takes into account the fair use of bandwidth and set a relatively high capital threshold required to launch a DDOS attack by malicious attackers while providing free services. This kind of limited and cost-effective free mechanism will spread the decentralized application into the scene of life.","twitter_screen_name":"etherzero_org","facebook_username":"EtherZero-554760518194015","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2607526","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3708/small/1_xyFQ9guLZglNr_kHTHQUTA.png?1547038728","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"41.761","developer_score":"52.276","community_score":"16.694","liquidity_score":"39.335","public_interest_score":"30.661","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"199521747.25","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

On 16 April 2013 Feathercoin successfully forked from Litecoin by the creation of its genesis block. As a cryptocurrency, creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source cryptographic protocol (the blockchain) and is not managed by any central authority. The hashing algorithm chosen for Feathercoin was the Proof-of-Work NeoScrypt, which had premiered on Phoenixcoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=NeoScrypt&view=market\">NeoScrypt</a> is 25% more memory intense, which makes it less feasible to create ASICs for it. \r\n\r\nThe main programmer is Peter Bushnell, at the time running the information technology for the Brasenose College of Oxford University. He explained his motivation for developing the coin in an interview with Vitalik Buterin. One month after launching Feathercoin, Peter Bushnell left his job as head of IT at the Brasenose College of Oxford University and lived off his Litecoin savings. Feathercoin was launched on 16th April 2013 and as developed by Peter Bushnell. It was forked from Litecoin, with the aim of making Feathercoin what Litecoin was supposed to be: a faster, more secure, and stable version of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mechanism is based on the Proof of Work (PoW) concept. The Feathercoin network runs on the NeoScrypt hashing algorithm, making it much easier and faster to mine. Feathercoin enjoyed rapid adoption by users soon after its launch, gaining immense popularity, and establishing itself as a worthy contender in a BTC/LTC dominated market.\r\n\r\nFeathercoin can be mined using either processors (CPUs) or graphics cards (GPUs). Due to the hashing algorithm of FTC, it cannot be mined with an ASIC card. Mining software is available for download at their official site. Wallets for FTC can be found over at their official website, including both desktop and mobile wallets..\r\n\r\nWhile the paper money you are used to carrying around is (or can be) stored in a physical wallet, cryptocurrencies, like all digital currencies, have to be stored in a software-based digital wallet. Although you will find links to feathercoin wallets throughout the web, the only safe way to know that you're downloading the latest and correct version is by scrolling to the bottom of the coin's official home page and selecting the button for your particular operating system. Feathercoin wallets are available for Android, Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.","twitter_screen_name":"feathercoin","facebook_username":"feathercoinftc","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"178286","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/feathercoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12/small/feathercoin.png?1548126014","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1366070400000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"44.448","developer_score":"63.017","community_score":"43.475","liquidity_score":"13.369","public_interest_score":"31.844","total_supply":"336000000","circulating_supply":"205509573.00773","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

We believe that this cycle can be disrupted by reducing energy demand at the consumer level by use of alternative energy devices which are able to produce energy from renewable or free sources.

Targeting the $47B online gambling market, FunFair isn’t actually a casino. Instead, the underlying gaming technology is licensed out to casinos and other gambling platforms. The FunFair team is attempting to solve some of the biggest problems online casinos face: slow performance, high operating costs, and lack of user trust. Through the use of blockchain technology and Fate Channels, an in-house built version of state channels, the products they license have the potential fix all of them.\r\n\r\nFUN is an ERC-20 token that you use in every part of the FunFair platform. It’s the only token accepted for in-game credits, how game creators in the marketplace are paid, what casinos must pay their licensing with and receive revenues in, and all fees on the platform must be paid in FUN. A total of 11,000,000,000 FUN tokens were created on June 22, 2017, and no more will be created. With a fixed supply, the token is deflationary and should experience sharp increases in price over time as demand for it increases. Furthermore, the FUN that’s paid as fees will be burned for the first two years which should further drive price upwards. Casinos can also stake the FUN tokens in their bankrolls to receive additional dividends.\r\n\r\nThe 30+ person FunFair team is based out of London and is led by Jez San, OBE. San’s entire career has revolved around entrepreneurship and the computer gaming industry. He founded Argonaut Software as a teen and created the first chip to power 3D games like Star Fox and Harry Potter. Rounding out his resume, San also founded the 3D online poker room, PKR, and is an investor in one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken. Other members of the team are just as impressive. Jeremy Longley, founder and CTO, co-founded PKR with San and has over 15 years of experience managing development teams. FunFair COO, David Greyling, was previously the International Director of William Hill – a worldwide betting and gaming company.\r\n\r\nFunFair is attempting to enter the gigantic online gaming market by providing a solution that’s unique to the blockchain industry. Instead of acting as a casino, the company is licensing out their technology to other casinos which helps to mitigate their liability and risk.

The second tier, or masternodes, is responsible for the specific functionalities introduced by FuturoCoin. It provides, in particular, immediate execution of all transactions (InstantSend) with simultaneous protection against double spending. In addition, FuturoCoin developers, who know about scalability issues occurring in other cryptocurrencies, have used the second tier of nodes to maintain a minimum and fixed transaction fee. FuturoCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.\r\nFuturoCoin is now mainly used by over 2 mln community of clients of FutureNet network. \r\n\r\nTake advantage of safe and convenient solutions:\r\n1.

GMC tokens go on sale at the end of September through the GameCoin ICO.\r\n\r\nGameCoin aims to increase the revenue of the gaming industry by 3 times – or 300 billion dollars per year. It aims to allow players to earn money from their hobby. And, within a year, the developers claim the capitalization of GameCoin will “exceed and billion dollars and will continue to grow rapidly.”\r\nGameCoin is being proposed as a way to monetize the world of free gaming. The GameCoin whitepaper explains that the majority of gaming revenue comes from 10% of users. Today, developers are struggling to monetize the remaining 90% of users. GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nBasically, GameCoin’s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually no cost to themselves – it’s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.\r\n\r\nIn more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each developer will be able to make their own fork – so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks).","twitter_screen_name":"gamecom666","facebook_username":"Gamecom-2055954348021983","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2258262","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2046/small/game.png?1547742459","country_origin":"CN","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1508976000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"16.037","developer_score":"13.732","community_score":"5.284","liquidity_score":"34.468","public_interest_score":"43.89","total_supply":"2000000000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Useful as it may be as a store of value, it is impractical for daily usage due to its' weight and difficulty to divide accurately into smaller quantities. And no longer will we face the issue of liquidity faced by gemstones. Lighter than gold but yet impossible to divide, we now offer a solution that has plagued humanity since the beginning of the recognition of gemstones as valuable and desirable. \r\n\r\nWhat we offer is simple. Whereas most crypto-currencies are backed by nothing and are mere copies, clones, or identical forked code of more famous ones, and yet others serve some sort of functional capacity, GemVault Coin also has a functional use while its' creations are backed by real assets. We will begin with GemVault Coin. GemVault Coin functions as a type of gate key to all of the other asset tokens offered by GemVault. We will provide our own exchange, upon which all of our assets will be traded. The assets, which are in fact crypto-currencies, are only able to be purchased with GemVault Coin. These cryptographic assets are backed by all natural, untreated, high-quality, and certified gemstones.","twitter_screen_name":"","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"4635902","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5243/small/gemvault-coin-logo.png?1547040729","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"5.665","developer_score":"12","community_score":"0","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"24.654","total_supply":"350000000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Groestlcoin is strictly a cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer (p2p) payments. The coin serves the same end-goal as other transactional cryptos like Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a> but accomplishes that goal with a different set of attributes.\r\n\r\nGroestlcoin accomplished a few significant “firsts” with its feature set. It was the first coin to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the first to perform a Lightning Network transaction on mainnet. With the implementation of the Lightning Network, Groestlcoin has minimal fees. Transferring 10,000 GRS (~$6000 at the time of this writing) costs fractions of a fraction of a cent. Even if the GRS price rises 1000x, the transaction fee would be just a couple of pennies. Groestlcoin utilizes two rounds of Grøstl-512 for its mining algorithm. This mining algo is ASIC-resistant, for now.\r\n\r\nA developer going by the Bitcointalk username “Gruve_P” launched Groestlcoin on March 22, 2014. Since then, the team has grown to over 20 people spread all around the world. Most team members prefer to stay relatively anonymous, only sharing their first name and country of origin on the website. The team has been consistent in releasing new versions of the platform every three months. With such consistency, it shouldn’t shock you to hear all that they’ve accomplished in the last four years. The team activated SegWit in January 2017 and is currently working on Lightning Network releases for both their mobile and desktop wallets. The team and community have also built eleven different Android wallets, ten different wallets for Blackberry, and three for iOS. They’ve created more than ten desktop wallets as well.\r\n\r\nGRS has recently seen a rise in popularity, with most CPU and GPU miners moving away from networks like BTC, where ASIC miners have completely saturated the mining pool. With its robust features, focus on privacy, and innovative technology, GRS is a very lucrative choice for these miners, and has the possibility to be the next big coin that hits the market. While investing in any cryptocurrency is subject to their inherent volatile nature, the immense market potential of Groestlcoin, along with its pioneering technology and dedicated development team, make it a very strong consideration for investment.","twitter_screen_name":"GroestlcoinTeam","facebook_username":"GroestlCoinGRS","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"525926","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/groestlcoin","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/71/small/image001.png?1547033733","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1395446400000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"49.052","developer_score":"52.114","community_score":"53.232","liquidity_score":"32.83","public_interest_score":"30.076","total_supply":"105000000","circulating_supply":"72906818.8873662","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The more successful the project, the more people will know about it!\r\n\r\nIn the last two years, the world has experienced new epidemies due to refusal of vaccinations: unvaccinated people are infected with highly contagious infections like measles with a 100 percent chance. In 2018, according to WHO, more than 82,000 children and adults in Europe were infected with measles, the epidemy began in 2017: then the number of cases increased to 13,000 per year. Compare: in 2016, there were only 5,273 registered cases in Europe. There are many rumors around vaccination, fake information and false research. And the rare side effects that all drugs have are artificially exaggerated.\r\n\r\nAccording to WHO, messages about danger of vaccines in most cases are fake in nature. At the same time rare negative aspects of vaccination are widely publicized in mass media, while many positive aspects are often silenced and cause less interest in people.\r\n\r\nScientists who conducted inaccurate researches are to be blamed for hysteria against vaccinations as well. In 1998, the British magazine The Lancet published a study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, that vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella cause autism. The study was widely reported, and its findings were widely spoken of. However, the work was withdrawn after other scientists recognized Wakefield's findings unsubstantiated. Later the doctor was deprived of his license.\r\n\r\nRefusal of vaccinations is also associated with belief in conspiracy theory, primarily in the conspiracy of pharmaceutical companies to make a profit. However, the mass vaccination campaign is almost 10 times cheaper than the treatment of all patients if it is not carried out.\r\n\r\nAnti-vaccinators are also benefit to adherents of unproven alternative medicine. After all, in addition to drugs for the treatment of diseases, refusal of vaccination allows you to sell a lot of other drugs, for example, dietary supplements for improving immunity and antivirals. That's just unlike vaccines such supplements have no proven effectiveness, no one checks them, and some of them are just homoeopathy, which is equal to the placebo effect and is not recommended for patients in developed countries for a long time, for example, in the UK and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe world health organization website lists vaccines for thirty-five diseases. Some of them are difficult and dangerous with complications, others simply do not have treatment. In the long term, vaccinated people create strong collective immunity. If around one unvaccinated and ill person there are ten vaccinated, the epidemic simply can not break out. For such a barrier against the disease, 95% of the population must be vaccinated.\r\n\r\nThere are people who can’t be vaccinated because of contraindications (infants, people with immunodeficiency or other severe chronic conditions), therefore, it is necessary to achieve 100% vaccination, among those who can be vaccinated in principle.\r\n\r\nStatistics is affected by anti-vaccinators who, knowingly or because of fear, do not vaccinate themselves and their children. German doctors wrote an article in which they identified several types of anti-vaccinators. They are classified for reasons of refusal:\r\n\"Careless\" do not take the threat seriously and do not think about diseases.\r\n\"Lazy\" just don't want to mess with it.\r\n\"Careful\" are always at a crossroads and will weigh all the\" pros \"and\" cons\" to the last.\r\n\"Suspicious\" fanatical against vaccinations and don't believe even the most common arguments from doctors.","twitter_screen_name":"Healthy_vaccin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"5123078","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8392/small/viV6ui6B_400x400.jpg?1557980650","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"3.421","developer_score":"0","community_score":"2.603","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"25.7","total_supply":"4800000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Rather than just looking at the software side of things, the project also tackles the hardware aspect. To realize the optimal performance of blockchain applications, things will need to change in the near future. As such, this team is building an architecture which uses thousands of CPU and FPGA resources to create a more versatile and scalable ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThere are a few aspects of the High-Performance Blockchain project to take into account. First of all, there is the chip-level acceleration engine which provides accelerated hardware chips to power this entire ecosystem. Secondly, the software side of the High-Performance Blockchain is integrated with the new dedicated hardware accelerated engine and focuses on depth and scaling customization. Third, the project claims it can produce a throughput in the millions of transactions without any major problems.\r\n\r\nWhile all of this sounds amazing, it is difficult to come by any real information regarding the technical aspects of either the hardware or the software side of High-Performance Blockchain. While the team mainly focuses on blockchain integration for real-world business cases, it remains to be seen how their chips will operate and how their algorithms are created. It seems the High-Performance Blockchain project is closely connected to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">NEO</a> infrastructure, which could introduce some interesting developments down the line.\r\n\r\nBuilding the High-Performance Blockchain infrastructure will take a lot of time and money. As such, the roadmap is filled with milestones which the team aims to achieve in the coming years. A testnet version of this project will be launched at some point in 2018, which will undergo further improvements for several months. The actual manner will launch in Q2 of 2018 if things go according to plan. However, the official version will not go live until mid-2019 at the earliest.

The first tier is the traditional token structure that participates in exchange transactions. The second tier uses the first tier token structure, launches a timed auction and float aiming at fiat money, mainly to solve the problem of token volatility, reduce volatility which is easy billing. INT will build a framework for machines and devices, and create a token, which will be used to facilitate the resource exchange between nodes and heterogeneous links (different nodes may create independent internal links). For example, a node may make a request and pay corresponding tokens to request other nodes (or links) to provide power, network, data, service and other possible resources. In addition, through zero knowledge proof (specific improvement as necessary), optional masking may be conducted to protect user privacy and improve security. \r\n\r\nThe Internet of things has developed rapidly in the last a few years, however, concerns have been raised for the standards of communication and data exchanges among manufacturers, the interests of manufacturers, user privacy, as well as fragmented model constraint on the overall IoT development. It is expected that more than 25 billion nodes will be connected on the internet in year 2020, however, if the interconnection within the whole network is not smooth, the fragmented Internet of Things would not fully realize value of the nodes. Without defining a common set of protocol standards, seeking support from individual manufacturers is but inefficient and costly. Through decentralized and economy driven methods, it is a new way to make standards for device interconnection. INT is the acronym for Internet Network Token. INT attempts to build a scheme that allows data and resources to flow freely within the network and to ensure user privacy in untrusted and decentralized machine federations. \r\n\r\nINTchain is a fundamental application platform of blockchain for promoting the ecological evolution of the IoT.

Alongside ION, Economy, a digital entertainment platform for gamers and game developers was also launched in April 2016. ION is based mostly on the idea of making it easier for game developers to incentivize participation in both their premium and free games. The motto of the ION cryptocurrency platform economy is “The Business of Fun”, and it mainly tries to add a social component to digital currency, making it fun and bringing in the possibility for networking.\r\n\r\nION is a digital currency which is primarily given as rewards and incentives to gamers playing on its platform, Economy. It aims to make cryptocurrency fun and social, while simultaneously rewarding gamers for participation. The ION cryptocurrency works on the “static proof-of-stake” consensus system, which ensures that inactive investors cannot take advantage of it. The “Connectivity” system it works on makes the rewards proportional to the number of active users, promoting the community and keeping things fair while encouraging more people to participate. ION has also implemented a master node network, which can be used to perform advanced functions and ensure smoother and much faster transactions for larger holders.\r\n\r\nThe best part of ION, perhaps, is that ION tokens are given as a reward to gamers playing on the economy platform, and they are free to trade the coins for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, too. Rather than other popular cryptocurrencies that focus on buying and selling of goods and are investment-centric (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>), ION is focused on the gaming sector. It aims to give active gamers an incentive for participation and game developers a chance to add monetary incentives to their freedom as well as premium games. It’s focused on “everything that’s fun”, according to the ionomy website, whose very motto is “The Business of Fun”.\r\n\r\nFor a cryptocurrency launched before the crypto boom in 2017, ION has its advantages, the main one being that it boasts of being “fun”, unlike any other currency. The reward of winning is adequate for a true gamer, but an incentive involving money doesn’t hurt. Games on the ION platform like “To The Moon (Beta)” and “Crypto Gravity” (available for both Android and iOS) are gaining ground among gamers, and ION can only go up from where it is currently. Another perk of the ION cryptocurrency is that if you invest in it, in-app purchases on the games in the ION platform come much cheaper. ION developers offer up to 50% off on the purchases, if ION tokens are used. The cryptocurrency has just about started gaining ground within the gaming community, and its motto of “fun” and accessible nature are its selling points, making it likely to give returns in the long term.","twitter_screen_name":"ionomics","facebook_username":"ionomy","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1443633","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ionomy/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/465/small/ion.png?1547034174","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1431734400000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"37.391","developer_score":"51.192","community_score":"30.429","liquidity_score":"8.454","public_interest_score":"40.497","total_supply":"32850824","circulating_supply":"24452607.1239688","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">ETH</a>. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all.

It was created by Kik Interactive in September 2017 in a token distribution event, raising over $98 million from 10,000 participants. The purpose of the token is to facilitate value transfers in digital services such as gaming applications and social media, and will initially be launched on the Kik messenger to leverage the application's 15 million monthly active users. Use of Kin over other tokens is incentivised by providing a daily reward to developers of these digital services based on their usage.\r\n\r\nKik’s latest effort has been allowing users to reward creators directly. Today’s digital content and social media companies monetize their websites using advertising. This model requires that these companies go after economies of scale, adding new users quickly. They also want new users to spend as much time as possible on their platform so they can maximize ad views and therefore revenue. The leadership at Kik believes this trend toward the attention economy is a mistake. Their philosophical argument for creating a cryptocurrency is that advertising and attention seeking is cheapening the content ecosystem and our relationships. Using Kin Coin, they hope to enable consumers to pay creators and developers directly. This crowdsourced patronage is an important trend in social media. We’re seeing similar projects that have gained traction with the likes of Kickstarter or Patreon. These services allow people to pay creators directly, without the need for advertisers. \r\n\r\nKik needed further funding in 2017. Instead of raising money from venture capitalists, they decided to launch an ICO to create the token behind their new rewards points system. The token sale for Kin Coin was a success, raising $98 million in September 2017. The sale included over 10,000 people from 117 countries. Unfortunately, Canadian citizens were not allowed to participate, and Kik is a Canadian company. Some argue this dampened demand and contributed to the ICO not reaching its hard cap of $110 million. A total of 10 trillion KIN will exist, of which 750 billion are currently in circulation. The token launched on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>.\r\n\r\nKin Coin will launch on Kik later this year. The idea is for monetization to integrate seamlessly into the app. Users should be able to reward creators simply from their wallets with a few taps. Kin Coin is designed to be mobile-first, and a wallet app will arrive in the coming months as well. A few test users can use Kin Coin right now on Kik. The only thing you can do so far is buy some custom digital stickers for use in chats. Expect more features upon launch later this year. Over time, the idea is to allow other digital services and media applications to also integrate KIN. It won’t be exclusive to Kik. However, Kik will be the first company to launch Kin Coin integration.\r\n\r\nKIN’s value decreased following the ICO as hype died down. In January, KIN rode the wave along with much of the cryptocurrency market to an all-time high. Since January, the price has fallen, but never to pre-January levels. KIN is an ERC-20 token, so you can store it anywhere that accepts Ethereum. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect?locale=en\">MyEtherWallet</a> is a good option for paper storage. Of course, a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet is the gold standard for security. Kin has the backing of a major startup with a large active user base. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well crypto integrates with an existing community, especially a younger community who might not care about crypto. They just want things to work well. Solving the problem of giving crypto a great user experience is an important step to making crypto useful. If Kik can figure that out with the Kin Coin then this will be an interesting project to follow.","twitter_screen_name":"kin_foundation","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/959/small/kin.png?1547975176","country_origin":"CA","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1505174400000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"32.896","developer_score":"0","community_score":"46.44","liquidity_score":"29.698","public_interest_score":"34.812","total_supply":"10000000000000","circulating_supply":"313886744213.1464","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Tapping on the protocol, developers can build payment flows and financial apps, including instant token swap services, erc20 payments, and innovative financial dapps - helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere.\r\n\r\nKyber Network maintains liquidity through the dynamic reserve pool. The pool contains all of the Reserve Entities in the system. Having multiple entities in the pool prevents monopolization and keeps exchange rates competitive. When a user requests an exchange, the Kyber smart contract makes the exchange through the Reserve Entity with the best exchange rate for the user. By allowing external Reserve Entities, Kyber Network prevents centralization and opens the door to low-volume token listings. External reserves may be fine with taking on the risk of storing less popular tokens that the Kyber reserves don’t list.\r\nTo prevent bad actors in the reserve pool, Kyber Network has few safeguards. The network will flag any exchange rate for special approval that’s greatly outside the norm. To protect funds in a public reserve, Kyber makes all exchanges using them available through a transparent fund management model.\r\n\r\nThe Kyber team is impressive. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loiluu/\">Loi Luu</a>, Yaron Velner, and Victor Tran are the founders behind the project. Luu previously created Oyente, the first open-source security analyzer for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> contracts, and cofounded SmartPool, a decentralized mining pool project. Velner has been active in the Ethereum bug bounty program, and Tran is also a lead developer at SmartPool. The team has a well-rounded advisory board with the most notable member being <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitalik-buterin-267a7450\">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum wunderkind. In August 2017, Kyber successfully launched their testnet beta. They plan on releasing their live product in Q1 this year in which you’ll be able to trade between Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. The project has an extensive list of partners including <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/request-network\">Request Network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wax\">Wax</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storm\">Storm</a>.\r\n\r\nBecause it’s an ERC20 token, you can store KNC in any wallet with ERC20 support. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect\">MyEtherWallet</a> is the most popular online option. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask\">MetaMask</a> works as well.

The different organizations such as doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers can request permission to access a patient’s record to serve their purpose and record transactions on the distributed ledger. Medicalchain provides solutions to today’s health record problems. The platform is built to securely store and share electronic health records. By digitizing health records and empowering users we can leverage countless industry synergies.\r\n\r\nMedicalchain is building a platform for secure storage and utilization of electronic health records on the blockchain. The company is also building a telemedicine platform to allow users to directly connect with healthcare professionals, share their records and get consultations, second opinions, online through a secure channel.The company was originally founded in February 2016 to provide a software solution inside hospitals. The solution is known as ‘Discharge Summary’ and it uses a workflow tool to accurately write an assessment of a patient as they are being discharged from surgery or a long hospital visit. The software is currently being used by hospitals in UK and the team decided to extend this project and go further with Medicalchain. \r\n\r\nMedicalchain wants people to have access to their health records everywhere. Today, you can travel far and wide and you will have access to your phone, contacts, photos, files, bank accounts but not your health records - probably the most important and life saving information you need. In most developed countries around the world you, as a patient, have a legal right to request your records. Medicalchain is providing you with a platform to do that.

Melon is one such platform that works through a blockchain protocol allowing easy and efficient maintenance of cryptocurrencies. Acting as a hedge fund, Melon presents a fully customizable administration of your digital assets. You can use it as an online vault that allows you to store and transact your funds through its web portal. Melon was developed to meet the need for a cost-efficient and technologically advanced hedge fund to manage digital assets. Reto Trinkler and Mona El Isa founded the company, Melonport AG in July 2016. \r\n\r\nThe company created Melon as a digital asset management protocol. It is a first of its kind system that enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network. Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across multiple <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> networks to provide better efficiency and security for the assets. With the Melon protocol, users can save both time and money for investing in a hedge fund. Additionally, there is no requirement of a third party approval from a lawyer or advisor.\r\n\r\nMelon’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/melon\">ICO</a> was launched in February 2017 and sold out within 10 minutes. Melonport is aiming to bridge the gap between the portfolio managers and the investors by removing the role of the third parties such as law firms. Melonport’s CEO, Mona El Isa comes from a strong financial background and is versed with the problems of the investment industry.\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of work to be done on the Melon project, even though things are looking quite positive already. An audit of the protocol has been completed already, and the project continues to advance. No further specifics have been provided on the website, although it remains to be seen what the future holds. Bringing more value to Melon Coin would be a good idea, yet it remains to be seen how that might be achieved.","twitter_screen_name":"melonport","facebook_username":"melonport","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1763204","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melonproject","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/605/small/melon.png?1547034295","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1489536000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"40.515","developer_score":"63.296","community_score":"35.095","liquidity_score":"4.9","public_interest_score":"36.563","total_supply":"1232950","circulating_supply":"692211.7394002937","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.\r\nIt routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.\r\n\r\nAn initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.","twitter_screen_name":"LivepeerOrg","facebook_username":"livepeer","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/livepeer","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7137/small/livepeer.png?1547976208","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1538352000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"27.198","developer_score":"58.877","community_score":"29.105","liquidity_score":"11.85","public_interest_score":"28.32","total_supply":"14158233","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/primecoin\">Primecoin</a>, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> which led to the development of other amazing projects such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a>, and even crypto-collectibles such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ethereum-still-king-dapps-cryptokitties-need-1-billion-on-eos\">CryptoKitties</a>.","twitter_screen_name":"btc","facebook_username":"bitcoins","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1/small/bitcoin.png?1547033579","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1230940800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"89.958","developer_score":"94.582","community_score":"88.545","liquidity_score":"99.97","public_interest_score":"41.818","total_supply":"21000000","circulating_supply":"17804037","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Thanks to this innovative two tier network, Nucleon can offer innovative features in a trustless and decentralized way. Masternodes are used to power PrivateSend, InstantSend, and the governance and treasury system. Users are rewarded for running masternodes: 90% of the block reward is allocated to pay the masternode network. Masternodes are resposible for processing both PrivateSend and InstantSend. Masternode owners must have possession of 100,000,000 Nucleon, which they prove by signing a message and broadcasting to the network. Those coins can be moved at any time, but moving them will cause the masternode to fall out of queue and stop earning rewards. Masternode users are also given voting rights on proposals. Each masternode has one vote and this vote can be used on budget proposals or important decisions that affect Nucleon. Masternodes cost money and effort to host so they are paid a percentage of the block reward as an incentive, which is 90% of the Block Reward\r\n\r\nPRIVATESEND\r\nPrivateSend gives you true financial privacy by obscuring the origins of your funds. All the Nucleon in your wallet is comprised of different inputs, which you can think of as separate, discrete coins. PrivateSend uses an innovative process to mix your inputs with the inputs of two other people, without having your coins ever leave your wallet. You retain control of your money at all times\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS\r\nPrivateSend begins by breaking your transaction inputs down into standard denominations. These denominations are 0.01 NEON, 0.1 NEON, 1 NEON and 10 NEON – much like the paper money you use every day\r\nYour wallet then sends requests to specially configured software nodes on the network, called “masternodes”. These masternodes are informed then that you are interested in mixing a certain denomination. No identifiable information is sent to the masternodes, so they never know “who” you are\r\nWhen two other people send similar messages, indicating that they wish to mix the same denomination, a mixing session begins. The masternode mixes up the inputs and instructs all three users’ wallets to pay the now-transformed input back to themselves. Your wallet pays that denomination directly to itself, but in a different address (called a change address)\r\nIn order to fully obscure your funds, your wallet must repeat this process a number of times with each denomination. Each time the process is completed, it’s called a “round”. Each round of PrivateSend makes it exponentially more difficult to determine where your funds originated. The user may choose between 2-8 rounds of mixing\r\nThis mixing process happens in the background without any intervention on your part. When you wish to make a transaction, your funds will already be anonymized. No additional waiting is required\r\nNote that PrivateSend transactions will be rounded up so that all transaction inputs are spent. Any excess Nucleon will be spent on the transaction fee","twitter_screen_name":"MealwormsBiz","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"5060801","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7371/small/download_%2832%29.png?1547044062","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"4.865","developer_score":"0","community_score":"8.664","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"24.985","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It achieves this with a built in on-chain smart contract that controls the minting and burning of coins in a network of cryptographically unknown supply to facilitate value for users that choose to send their coins to offshore storage contracts while allowing everyone else to be exposed to the natural price movements of the currency.\r\n\r\nOffshore Storage\r\n\r\nOffshore Storage is Haven's built in smart contract/protocol that powers the stable value storage. In short, sending Haven to offshore storage (burning) records a reference on the blockchain to the current fiat value which can be restored later back into Haven by minting new coins to the tune of the current fiat value.\r\n\r\nThe key use cases for offshore contracts are:\r\n\r\nPoint of sales/payment gateway systems where goods can be bought with Haven and stores can immediately lock the fiat value in to protect from price fluctuations. This has the added benefit of keeping the stores business and income completely hidden on the blockchain as neither their wallet address or amounts are revealed.\r\n\r\nStoring large amount of money outside of the traditional banking system. Privacy focused cryptos are perfect for this but without a reliable way to maintain value through fluctuations the process of holding could be costly. Sending Haven offshore quite literally, makes money disappear until you want it back at which point the value remains intact.\r\n\r\nUntraceable | Hidden | Decentralized\r\n\r\nHaven uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions and stealth addresses meaning payments cannot be tracked or linked back to any user.\r\nWallet addresses and transaction amounts are completely obfuscated on the Haven blockchain making all activity invisible.\r\nThe Haven Protocol is decentralized and open source meaning no central control over the network.

Additionally, the live auction platform allows users to eventually trade their way up to full ownership of an exotic, allowing them to have the option to take the exotic for themselves. BITCAR tokens can be used to access the Bitcar.io platform and can be exchanged in CAR tokens which are backed up by the physical, hard-metal exotic cars and pegged to their USD value- acting as a \"stable coin\".

It allows decentralized applications (Dapps) of all sorts to be built within a secure, highly-scalable environment and be integrated directly into Particl’s flagship wallet: Particl Desktop\r\n\r\nParticl's mission is to foster a new decentralized, private and democratic economy supported by its platform and native currency (PART). All the fees generated by the platform are paid to the PART coin holders who are securing the network.\r\n\r\nPART is a privacy coin built from the Bitcoin Core codebase and is always updated to its latest version (currently 0.16.0). Capitalizing on the latest Bitcoin codebase not only allows the Particl platform to benefit from both Bitcoin’s stability and security, but also enables developers to leverage and easily fork any product, service and technology development from the Bitcoin developer community.\r\n          \r\nParticl Cold Staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins. In other words, it allows users to stake offline coins.\r\n\r\nParticl's decentralized marketplace is built with privacy at its core and offers a low-cost, secure and scalable e-commerce experience. Designed to work with almost any coin, it uses several privacy-enhancing features such as default private transactions, encrypted data, secure messaging, IP address anonymization, metadata stripping, private listings and more. It is exclusively governed by the Particl community which also earns all the fees generated by the marketplace.\r\n\r\nParticl is designed so that users can easily use and build decentralized applications that can then be integrated directly into Particl Desktop. These applications foster the decentralized, private and trustless Particl economy and are built using native privacy smart-contracts.\r\n\r\nPART can be sent as three different privacy states, each with their own degree of privacy and cost: Public, Blind, Anonymous. Each state has a purpose within our privacy platform and also provides the user full control of the linkability and traceability of their transactions. Particl is the first coin in history to deploy these privacy protocols on a Bitcoin Core codebase.\r\n\r\nThe Particl platform accepts a wide range of cryptocurrencies and provides maximum privacy at the same time. By using atomic swaps and third-party integrations, all incoming currency transactions are automatically converted into PART, Particl’s native currency. This way, you can use your favorite cryptocurrency while being protected by PART’s powerful privacy features.","twitter_screen_name":"particlproject","facebook_username":"ParticlProject","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1835782","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/839/small/Particl.png?1558053958","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1500249600000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"45.428","developer_score":"75.721","community_score":"43.094","liquidity_score":"10.01","public_interest_score":"7.186","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"9380012.97543113","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Just as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\">Monero</a> is solely focused on privacy, Ravencoin specializes in asset transfer – nothing more, nothing less. Although you can exchange assets over other blockchains, like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, that’s not their intended purpose. And the lack of specialization leads to problems that are specific to transferring assets. Ravencoin enables you to create and trade any real-world (e.g., gold bars, land deeds) or digital (e.g., gaming items, software licenses) assets on a network with only that in mind.\r\n\r\nRavencoin doesn’t have an established team. It’s an open-source project led by the core developers: RavoncoinDev, Tron, and Chatturga (discord usernames). Bruce Fenton, Board Member of The Bitcoin Foundation, advises the team. The core developers launched Ravencoin on January 3rd, 2018 and Fenton kicked off the launch with a Tweet announcing the start of mining. The project gained some notoriety when Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company had made a multi-million dollar investment into the team. Since then, the team has been building out the core functionality of asset support and rewards capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe release of the Ravencoin mainnet and increase in activity on the platform should help the price. Any news of notable companies or financial institutions utilizing the platform should also have a positive effect. Ravencoin offers just one thing: tokenized asset transfer. And that singular focus isn’t a bad thing. When projects attempt to solve a bunch of problems at once, they often create a bunch of half-baked solutions. Ravencoin is avoiding that. As a young project with seemingly endless competition, it’s difficult to predict how successful Ravencoin will be. An active community and backing from one of the most respected names in online retail are positive indicators, though. There’s a clear trend toward the tokenization of all types of assets. However, we have yet to see whether or not Ravencoin will be leading that change.","twitter_screen_name":"ravencoin","facebook_username":"Ravencoinofficial","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"3238497","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ravencoin","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3412/small/ravencoin.png?1548386057","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1514937600000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"57.909","developer_score":"77.345","community_score":"41.244","liquidity_score":"52.647","public_interest_score":"30.189","total_supply":"21000000000","circulating_supply":"3922450000","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD — every Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal — a token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 — it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into “wrapped ETH” (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This “tokenizes” ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into “pooled ETH” (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a “collateralized debt position” (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin — you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so — margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.","twitter_screen_name":"MakerDAO","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1442/small/dai.png?1547035520","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1513555200000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"56.079","developer_score":"70.249","community_score":"40.903","liquidity_score":"53.43","public_interest_score":"35.342","total_supply":"89899213","circulating_supply":"89899213","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Based on its own blockchain network and token LSK, Lisk will enable developers to build blockchain applications and deploy their own sidechain linked to the Lisk network, including a custom token. Thanks to the scalability and flexibility of sidechains, developers can implement and customize their blockchain applications entirely.\r\n\r\nLisk aims to make blockchain technology more accessible with a SDK written in JavaScript, special focus on user experience, developer support, in-depth documentations and the Lisk Academy. The Lisk network is operated using a highly efficient <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)</a> consensus model, which is secured by democratically elected delegates.\r\n\r\nLisk, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, raised over 14,000 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoins</a> in funding during its ICO (Initial Coin Offering), making it valued at over $4 billion at its peak.\r\n\r\nLisk is an open source blockchain platform which is powered by Lisk (LSK) Tokens that allows developers code decentralized applications (dApps) in JavaScript programming language. With Lisk, developers can build applications on their sidechain linked to the Lisk Network, and also with their custom token. In that sense, Lisk is similar with the Ethereum blockchain. However, the Lisk platform hasn’t been built to create smart contracts, but to develop diverse apps and functionalities using the LISK AppSDK framework.\r\n\r\nIt is a modular cryptocurrency as this coin involves ‘modules’ that serve as the basis of its design and construction.

The platform also allows users to place persistent content in the world, which remains in the same physical location even after the user has left the area or quit the application.

The platform provides consumers with access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger’s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They’re comprised of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger’s five co-founders make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai’s experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member of Bitfury and Boxer.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger’s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD) in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further. (Australia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world and thus has a large stake in the overall success the company).\r\n\r\nPower Ledger provides a blockchain-based marketplace that can truly change the world. Taking power away from large energy companies, Power Ledger gives local communities the ability to sell their excess solar power to neighbors. Power Ledger has created an energy distribution and tracking platform that allows consumers buy carbonless, sustainable energy at lower prices than what’s offered by traditional electric companies. Power Ledger has plans to expand its operations to three continents worldwide and has amassed an army of powerful strategic partners to help achieve its goals.  With the planned release of multiple applications for its platform in the immediate future, the project has positioned itself to disrupt multiple energy markets throughout the world creating a bright future for all participants involved in this green revolution.","twitter_screen_name":"PowerLedger_io","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2003922","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerLedger/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1104/small/power-ledger.png?1547035082","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1496448000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"36.849","developer_score":"0","community_score":"52.075","liquidity_score":"38.701","public_interest_score":"25.339","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"419736223.919905","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It is a smart contract platform which is does not involve in mining Tezos coins. It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.\r\n\r\nThe source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos’ proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS)</a> where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called “baking”. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nBaking & Endorsing\r\nBaking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 10,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 16 XTZ for baking a block.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 2 XTZ for each block they endorse.\r\n\r\nBlock Rewards & Inflation\r\nBlock rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. Currently, 38% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is currently 14%.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/tezos-xtz/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Tezos.","twitter_screen_name":"tezos","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/976/small/Tezos-logo.png?1547034862","country_origin":"US","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"61.888","developer_score":"81.694","community_score":"49.754","liquidity_score":"48.38","public_interest_score":"34.413","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"799750744.052401","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Its chief mission is to develop and research blockchain solutions that can be used for a global village ecosystem, and to provide funding and technological support for the development and maintenance of blockchain technology and the operation of ecosystems for related businesses.\r\n\r\nThe GlobalVillage Ecosystem team is an internationalized blockchain technology and operation team comprising members from countries such as China and the US. Through research into the social environment of villages in multiple countries, the team discovered that villages and cities have major differences. Villages are mainly acquaintance societies which have gradually formed semi-closed social networks characterized by blood relations, human relationships, and the pattern of difference sequence. These kinds of social relationships have limited the development of villages, as well as curbed their economic growth.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely those limitations of village society that the GlobalVillage Ecosystem Foundation saw when it decided to start off with the establishment and maintenance of village networks, in order to gradually set up a distributed, coordinated blockchain network based in villages around the world, with peer-to-peer task allocation and reliable identity verification.\r\n\r\nIn the GlobalVillage Ecosystem blockchain network, the distributed task-allocation system uses task-confirmation certificates to record the execution and feedback of tasks on the chain, and the service system uses rights certificates to record the confirmation and reception of service on the blockchain.

Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n","twitter_screen_name":"monero","facebook_username":"monerocurrency","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"583449","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/monero","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/69/small/monero_logo.png?1547033729","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1397779200000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"71.503","developer_score":"87.192","community_score":"66.333","liquidity_score":"64.705","public_interest_score":"38.563","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"17084878.6728283","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Today, anybody can become a cryptocurrency investor or trader with a minimum investment. This has brought many newcomers to cryptocurrency markets who did not reviously possess the technical know-how in currency trading. For instance, a taxi driver or a pianist can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies and ICOs in their spare time with a small amount of funds and make higher returns than with traditional market retail investment applications.\r\n\r\nSuccessful cryptocurrency traders have one thing in common - they do not guess. To make consistently positive returns, they dedicate days, if not weeks, researching their first currency purchase. It can take them months or years to develop technical and market specific knowledge to invest in multiple cryptorelated assets effectively.

The decentralized network facilitates self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes and applications. OmiseGo builds an app with our SDK to enable wallet-to-wallet transactions of crypto and fiat currencies, loyalty points, game credits and more. It uses the OMG network to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on chain. Besides, it offers a decentralized exchange mechanism to provide multi-asset and cross-chain interoperability, that is scalable and secure via <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof-of-stake</a>. \r\n\r\nOmiseGO is building a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=9&view=market\">decentralized exchange</a>, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network of validators which enforce behavior of all participants. It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants. This high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from fiat-backed issuers to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and native cryptocurrencies).\r\n\r\nUnlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms, this allows for decentralized exchange of other blockchains and between multiple blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token. Markets may be able to significantly reduce spreads and encourage market assurance via decentralizing custody and increased transparency of market activity. This is achieved using smart contracts, protocol tokens enforcing correct market behavior of orderbook matching, a new construction of Ethereum bonded external enforcement of clearinghouse activity, and commitments to historical exchange data for use with Ethereum smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits such as access. Through the open source, white-label SDK, digital wallet providers can connect to the public OMG network to enable users to transact any digital assets, including crypto and fiat currencies. It has high security because bonding to the Ethereum blockchain creates secure token custody, decentralized exchange of all Ethereum assets, and ultra-secure transaction validation. It is very stable as the Plasma architecture allows for unlimited scalability with unprecedented transaction speed: millions, and potentially billions of transactions per second. \r\n\r\nOmiseGO allows for stakeholders, from individuals to issuers, to have significantly greater assurance in the financial mechanisms of society. With the emerging popularity of eWallet platforms, siloed networks are becoming a problem. This creates a unique opportunity for fiat tokens to interchange across a decentralized network, along with cross compatibility with cryptocurrencies. In order to build this decentralized interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities, as well as incentives around creating well-functioning liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nEventually, these issued tokens may asymptotically get closer and closer to full decentralization (including user-owned keys) which maximizes agency of the individual. This can be achieved by creating not only transparency in the business process of payment interchange, but also removing the ownership of the business process itself from a single trusted entity.\r\n\r\nThe OmiseGo team has already been recognized as up and coming “Fintech Rockstars” by Forbes for their contributions to date. Omise contributed $100,000 in funding to the Ethereum foundation’s DEVGRANTS which is a program to help new Ethereum focused projects, develop the code bases and implement community evangelism. This indicates their commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.This has helped them amass a fairly stacked advisory board. The OmiseGO board lists the co-founders of Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">Golem</a>, Tendermint, Cosmos and even the Lightning Network as advisors. That’s quite a justice league of crypto-superstars. \r\n\r\nAlthough many cryptos are focused on disrupting global banking, Omise and OmiseGO are actually following current trends in the banking industry.

Any jurisdiction is run by the most ancient and inefficient tool ever – people. The only operating link between them is absolute subordination which entails corruption and crisis. Nowadays, the total failure of such a system has proven itself: most innovative technological solutions in all branches of activity are being generated outside of state control (EVs, drones, alternate network protocols, blockchain technology, crypto-currency, car-sharing, crowdfunding, social networks, just to mention a few).\r\n\r\nChange is only possible if a new form of e-agreement is introduced for everyone, the so-called Public Agreement. The idea of such a treaty has been floating around for a while, however, it was technically impossible to implement it before. We are creating a virtual jurisdiction outside the bounds of existing jurisdictions but with the prospect of possible interaction with them. Therefore, in due course we will have to change the status of the virtual jurisdiction so it becomes a territorial one in the framework of the current international law.","twitter_screen_name":"MFCoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"3098405","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5451/small/mfcoin.jpg?1556174633","country_origin":"RU","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"24.185","developer_score":"43.057","community_score":"4.847","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"27.129","total_supply":"50000000","circulating_supply":"19969750","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It is written in Java and JavaScript with 100% original source code. NEM has a stated goal of a wide distribution model and has introduced new features in blockchain technology in its proof-of-importance (POI) algorithm. NEM also features an integrated P2P secure and encrypted messaging system, multisignature accounts and an Eigentrust++ reputation system.\r\n\r\nEssentially, NEM is designed as a financial blockchain solution and can be used for payment, clearing and settlement in a private environment which is highly controlled. This means that NEM meets several of the regulatory requirements and guidelines in the financial industry. This allows it to be used to settle (change of ownership) any asset via the blockchain. Mijin which is a private chain of NEM has gained popularity and companies such as Hitachi have already embraced it.\r\n\r\nWhy NEM?\r\nMany banks around the world have come to accept the importance of blockchain technology. In fact, a good number of banks in the U.S, India and Japan have already started using the technology. Because banks generally employ the smart contract concept, NEM’s platform which is asset-friendly can be used to settle any asset. In settling assets, speed, security, and reliability are very important to a mainstream institution which is what this crypto offers. NEM addresses these issues by repackaging its blockchain into a private chain and presenting it as Mijin.\r\n\r\nNEM crypto is also applicable in the technology world. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a> which use mining to increase the number of coins, XEM uses something called ‘harvesting’. In this process, blocks are generated and a person is rewarded for work contributed using transaction fees. Every block has a certain number of transactions which attract an unknown amount of fees. This keeps the participants incentivized to continue harvesting. For a blockchain user to be allowed to harvest, one must go through a forging mechanism process called Proof-of-Importance (POI).\r\n\r\nPOI is the algorithm used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user's importance is determined by how many coins they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, as well as a number of other relevant signals to achieve consensus. POI is different from other initiatives which use a fee-sharing model that does not take into consideration one's overall support of the network. In proof-of-stake systems a person needs to have large numbers of coins to form a block, but in NEM transactions volume and trust become factors. This was designed to encourage users of NEM to not simply hold XEM but instead actively carry out transactions.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for entering the importance calculation, an account must have at least 10,000 vested XEM. All accounts owning more than 10,000 vested XEM have a non-zero importance score. With a supply of 8,999,999,999 XEM, the theoretical maximum number of accounts with non-zero importance is 899,999. In practice, the number of actual accounts with non-zero importance is not expected to approach the theoretical max due to inequalities in held XEM and also the temporal costs associated with vesting. If NEM becomes very popular, a threshold of 10,000 vested XEM could be undesirable. If necessary, this number could be updated in the future via a hard fork, which is the same procedure for adjusting transaction fees and other parameters related to harvesting.","twitter_screen_name":"nemofficial","facebook_username":"ourNEM","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"654845","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nem","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/242/small/nem.png?1547034011","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1427760000000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"62.887","developer_score":"74.595","community_score":"52.511","liquidity_score":"58.046","public_interest_score":"37.471","total_supply":"8999999999","circulating_supply":"8999999999","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20 utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque. \r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.\r\n\r\nA user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.\r\n\r\nCreated back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and co-founder of Kerf Software.\"\r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token is created by the team that built the <a href=\"https://brave.com/coi600\">Brave browser</a>, an open-source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers.

In some locations, travelers who do not want to be exposed to market volatility can choose the AEUR coin, a coin that is pegged 1:1 with the Euro by ArdorGate in cooperation with MisterTango.\r\n\r\nC2C Technology\r\nThe technology of C2C consists of the use of our ATMs that accept both bills and coins, as well as portable C2C devices for merchants known as the C2C Pocket.\r\n\r\nWith our technology, you can better make online purchases by converting your cash to crypto-currencies, as well as use our printed cryptocurrency bills for use in retail chains worldwide.\r\n\r\n1. C2C Pocket\r\nThe C2C Pocket is an innovative payment solution device which prints out C2C notes which hold a set amount of a cryptocurrency, either as change to the customer or sold directly to them, as well as claims the coins on those bills with a built-in scanner or receives coins through the C2C Merchant App.\r\n\r\nFeatures and Specifications\r\nThe C2C Pocket is an ideal way for merchants and users to have a way to easily interact with the complete C2C ecosystem on-the-go.\r\n\r\nThis device is also complete for other forms of payment such as a credit card reader, an on-board camera with LED light, on top of having a mobile printer for receipts and both, WiFi, and 4G functionality in addition to cryptocurrency management functions.\r\n\r\nThe C2C mobile app also prints out C2C notes so it is an ideal solution for shops giving or selling cryptocurrencies such as C2C tokens to customers or giving them as coupons.\r\n\r\nThe C2C Pocket beta version will be expected to be released to selected merchants for testing for the remainder of Q2 2018.\r\n\r\n2. C2C ATM\r\nThe C2C ATM is a machine which accepts coins and notes from many countries and prints out C2C notes. These notes can contain most cryptocurrencies supported by C2C, including the C2C token itself.\r\n\r\nLocations of the C2C ATMs will be strategically located in selected shopping centers and ports of entry and exit such as airports and train stations where many people from around the world gather. These locations are also where travelers tend to need to dispose of their spare change as they may not be needing it in their home country or in the country they are about to travel to.\r\n\r\nThe ATM will be a 2-way machine, so users can also withdraw local currencies in exchange for cryptocurrencies as well as convert their CtC notes to local currencies, much like redeeming paper wallets.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is currently ongoing. The beta version is expected to be released in June 2018 for testing in several locations.\r\n\r\nC2C has chosen the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor Platform</a>, the first scalable blockchain as a service platform for businesses, for its public blockchain use including the C2C token, as it features these four key characteristics:\r\n\r\nADVANCED ARCHITECTURE – The unique parent child chain architecture of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor Platform</a> allows the C2C token and other future utilizations to have cross-chain interoperability. This means that as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor</a> grows and more child chains gets added, other tokens, whether assets, currencies, or child chain coins, will quickly and easily be able to be integrated into the C2C framework.\r\n\r\nEASE OF SETUP – Though our services allow users to easily acquire cryptocurrencies, we want to allow C2C token holders to easily and quickly set up a full wallet with the blockchain fully downloaded. With the Pruning feature on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor</a>, this means that blockchain bloat is heavily reduced and getting a full wallet, which is better for decentralization and independence, is much more convenient for our users compared with using any other platform.\r\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENT – The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor Platform</a> uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm which eliminates mining competition based on computing resources, therefore the use of the C2C token leaves a lower carbon footprint as less energy is needed to be spent and more economical hardware can be used, such as a Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nRELIABLE & MAINTAINABLE – <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor</a> uses the technology of Nxt, which has been running smoothly since 2013 and thus has years of production experience, which further ensures the stability of our frameworks. It is also developed in Java, the most popular development language for commercial applications, which makes it easier for C2C to build further using the technology.\r\n\r\nThe C2C Token\r\nThe C2C token was distributed to the numerous business partners and selected interested parties such as potential merchants, who came together to start the project and contributed resources for its initial startup phase. The token does not indicate any form of profit sharing in the present or future.\r\n\r\nThe token itself can be used as a currency within the platform for the purchase of premium services to be introduced in the future, as well as outside the system, especially with the use of C2C notes. Any further features of the C2C framework will always use the C2C token.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is planned that in the future there will be a public sale of tokens that represent some profit sharing rights and only the C2C token will be accepted for this. However, there will not be a set ratio for this as the C2C token is only used as a form of currency for this purpose. Further details about this token sale for profit participation tokens are yet to be determined. However, it has been decided that the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ardor\">Ardor Platform</a> will be used due to the Asset Control feature which makes it easy to comply with regulations around tokens that may be classified as a security.","twitter_screen_name":"c2catm","facebook_username":"C2Cofficial","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/C2CSystem/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4542/small/c2csystem.png?1547039834","country_origin":"LU","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1531353600000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"13.985","developer_score":"0","community_score":"25.368","liquidity_score":"0","public_interest_score":"30.522","total_supply":"300000000","circulating_supply":"300000000","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
{"_id":"byteball","homepage":["https://obyte.org/"],"blockchain_site":["https://explorer.byteball.org/"],"github":["https://github.com/byteball/ocore"],"bitbucket":[],"description":"Byteball is a decentralized system that allows tamper proof storage of arbitrary data, including data that represents transferable value such as currencies, property titles, debt, shares, etc. Storage units are linked to each other such that each storage unit includes one or more hashes of earlier storage units, which serves both to confirm earlier units and establish their partial order. The set of links among units forms a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Directed+Acyclic+Graph+%28DAG%29&view=market\">DAG (directed acyclic graph)</a>. There is an internal currency called ‘bytes’ that is used to pay for adding data into the decentralized database. Other currencies (assets) can also be freely issued by anyone to represent property rights, debt, shares, etc. Users can send both bytes and other currencies to each other to pay for goods/services or to exchange one currency for another; the transactions that move the value are added to the database as storage units.\r\n\r\nIn Byteball, you must pay a commission using a currency called “Bytes” to add data into the database. The name of Byteball’s currency directly reflects its value. Extremely intuitive, the number of Bytes you pay to add data to the database corresponds directly to the data size of your transaction. For instance, your commission fee to add 1 Kb of data would be 1,000 Bytes. Commission fees create a consistent system of value transfer that aligns the interests of all Byteball’s stakeholders. It also prevents users from spamming useless messages to the database. In addition to payment for storage fees, you can pay Bytes directly to other users for goods or services. Byteball has a second currency that can be used on its platform – Blackbytes. Unlike Byte transactions that are completely visible on the DAG, Blackbytes are significantly less traceable. Blackbyte data is not recorded in the public database; Instead, the transaction data is sent directly peer to peer.\r\n\r\nMade up of a small team of less then five members, Byteball is lead by its founder and lead developer, Anton Churyumov. Churyumov has extensive executive experience in the tech sector as he is co-founder and CEO of Teddy ID as well as co-founder and CIO of Platron. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Churyumov owns SMS Traffic, a Russian technology company that offers solutions and marketing for banks, insurance, and retail firms. Attending Moscow Engineering Physics Institue from 1991 to 1997, Churyumov received his degree in Theoretical Physics.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of Byteball is identity verification. Every Byteball user can link their Byteball address to their real-world identity. Byteball has partnered with Jumio, the leading provider of identity verification services, in order to verify its users’ identities. Once verified, a user’s personal data is securely stored directly in their wallet. At the same time, a hash of the personal data is stored on the public DAG and signed by a trusted attestor. This feature allows Byteball users to decide what to disclose and to whom. When you want to disclose your identity to a service provider, you just pull it out of your wallet in a few clicks. This is useful when participating in ICOs, for example.\r\n\r\nThere aren’t many other cryptocurrency platforms built using DAG technology out there, so Byteball doesn’t really have many competitors. However, the biggest DAG-based platform is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iota\">IOTA</a>, and they are currently much more popular and successful than Byteball. That said, Byteball and IOTA are different platforms with different focuses, so they shouldn’t really be considered direct competitors. Right now, the main challenge for Byteball is to gain more popularity and adoption. It’s still a pretty obscure cryptocurrency platform. First and foremost, Byteball will have to up their marketing game so more people know who they are and what they do. The technology and features are solid, so once they gain more exposure, Byteball could potentially become incredibly popular.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-byteball-cryptocurrency-with-no-blockchain/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Byteball.","twitter_screen_name":"ObyteOrg","facebook_username":"obyte.org","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"1608859","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteBall/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/561/small/byteball.png?1547564361","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"46.034","developer_score":"72.013","community_score":"43.836","liquidity_score":"6.566","public_interest_score":"27.533","total_supply":"1000000","circulating_supply":"703558.207515747","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

COBINHOOD Exchange provides spot trading and margin trading with zero trading fees to maximize traders’ profit and market liquidity. COBINHOOD Exchange has a utility ERC20 token, called COB, which aims to maximize traders' profits with benefits tied to the exchange.\r\n\r\nCOBINHOOD Exchange was officially launched on December 18, 2017, with the early platform and company developments started August of the same year. The project is incepted by the former CEO of 17 live streaming, Chen Tai Yuan, a 26-year-old serial entrepreneur, and former engineer at Google, Wei-Ning Huang. On September 13, 2017, COBINHOOD's ICO officially launched with the introduction of the COB token. The funds raised from the COB token ICO sale is used by the company to develop COBINHOOD Exchange. Few days later, actor Jamie Foxx tweeted his support for the ICO. On October 22, 2017, the COBINHOOD Exchange ICO ended  and received a total of 45,254.9 ETH (equivalent to US$13,216,883 during the date of ICO end) with 244,773,856 COB tokens distributed to 17,433 ICO participants.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of crypto assets deposited at COBINHOOD will be stored in an offline multi-signature (multisig) wallet. It is estimated that 98% of assets will be stored offline, while 2% of assets will remain in an online wallet allowing for faster user deposit and withdrawa. Each offline multisig wallet consists of 8 HSMs (Hardware Security Modules), which will require passcodes from 5 out of the 8 HSMs to be accessed. If one of the HSM administrators is compromised, the multisig wallet will remain secure. Furthermore, the administrators of the HSMs are located in different countries (geo distributed) adding to COBINHOOD’s security system. Furthermore, all crypto asset deposits in COBINHOOD’s online wallet will be backed by insurance. Self or bot trading will also be regulated in the COBINHOOD Exchange as the trading engine is equipped with multiple automated configurations to prevent self-trading of orders entered by the same person with multiple accounts. Furthermore, machine learning and data analysis will also be set up to bolster security mechanisms for self-trading restrictions.","twitter_screen_name":"cobinhood","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"2169745","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cobinhood","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/971/small/cobinhood.png?1547739572","country_origin":"TW","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1505088000000"}},"ico_data":true,"coingecko_score":"36.736","developer_score":"46.138","community_score":"44.305","liquidity_score":"0.892","public_interest_score":"29.709","total_supply":"1000000000","circulating_supply":"410999846.9899732","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

OK06ETT provides an easy and efficient trading option for traders to replicate and tract the OK06 index, which reflects the performance of the digital asset market. By giving a variety of tracked tokens, OK06ETT fulfills the majority of your investment needs in digital asset.\r\n\r\n1) Measurement: The measurement of OK06ETT is “unit”. The value of each unit is measured in USDT.\r\n2) Objective of OK06ETT: To bring satisfactory return to traders in long-term and also to satisfy traders’ needs of diversifying their portfolio, this portfolio tracks OK06ETT index as the benchmark because of its comprehensive and representable features. A fully-replicated passive trading managing method is adopted to minimize the error.\r\n3) Portfolio management: A full replication method is adopted, which is 100% copying the components of the index being tracked. Fine adjustment will be made according to the future changes of the components and weights of the index.\r\n4) Performance measurement: It is evaluated based on the return of OK06ETT index.\r\n5) Portfolio Features: As a passive management method is adopted, the return would be highly correlated to the index’s performance. As OK06ETT index reflects the volatility and trend of the whole digit asset market, a diversified portfolio would effectively lower the risk, in compare with buying only a single digital asset.\r\n\r\nSubscription and Redemption\r\n\r\n1) Available period: The portfolio will open for subscription from 01:00 to 59:00 (minute) every hour on the hour. Your subscription will be settled at 01:00 of the next hour, along with all other subscriptions and redemptions.\r\n2) Subscription settlement: All subscription and redemption will be processed with the same unit of measurement. The settlement price will be the weighted average price of the trading pairs in USDT equivalent.\r\n3) Full subscription: Users can subscribe by using USDT and paying a certain amount of fees. The system will calculate each user’s number of successful subscription by using the settlement price.\r\n4) Partial redemption: The redemption of your units proportionally. After redemption request is made, the system will help to redeem (the number of units * the components of each unit) back into the user account, and will charge the fees accordingly.\r\n5) Full redemption: Redemption of the units held then sold as USDT. The system will redeem the number of units held into USDT as requested, and charge service fees. Under full subscription, the amount of USDT the user can redeem = settlement price * redeemed units – service fee. Under full redemption, a certain amount of unit will need to be sold as USDT; therefore, the value will fluctuate.\r\n\r\nApplicable Fees\r\n1) Administration fee: A certain amount of fee is charged for the daily operations and administration of the portfolio. The portfolio holder will have to pay the fee according to the holding period. Every time when users perform a subscription or redemption, fees will be charged proportionally from their assets. The current annual administration fee is 0%.\r\n2) Full subscription fee: When you are subscribing for the portfolio with USDT, a certain amount of fee will be charged. However, the subscription will also affect the proportion of the components, which may cause changes in the returns of other portfolio holders. Therefore, 50% of the subscription fee will be collected into the portfolio asset. The full subscription fee for the time being is 0%.\r\n3) Redemption fee (in USDT): A certain amount of fee will be charged for redeeming the portfolio.

The project aims to upgrade bitcoin by implementing smart contracts, among other features.\r\n\r\nUnited Bitcoin was launched by Jeff Garzik, well-known for spearheading the Segwit2x hard fork proposed for the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin (BTC)</a> blockchain. That hard fork would have doubled the block size of the original bitcoin blockchain, providing a better scaling solution. Obviously, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> was the first blockchain to implement smart contracts.\r\n\r\nBitcoin (BTC) does not currently have smart contracts. We don’t know of any bitcoin hard fork that has successfully added smart contracts to the bitcoin network. Despite these challenges, United Bitcoin believes it can accomplish the goal of adding smart contracts to the bitcoin network. The team also wants to add Lightning Network support. United Bitcoin launched with an official hard fork. The currency was officially launched on December 12, 2017, with an event in Silicon Valley. The fork launched at BTC block height #498777, which occurred at around 12:00 GMT.\r\n\r\nThe team behind United Bitcoin purportedly began developing the project in June 2016. The first smart contract was fully tested in May 2017, followed by a beta test in September 2017. On December 5, the 0.5 version of the project was migrated to Github.\r\n\r\nUnited Bitcoin might be the most controversial bitcoin hard fork in history. The internet is freaking out over how the project is “going after” Satoshi Nakamoto’s original bitcoins. In fact, the project appears to be targeting any accounts that were not active between November 11 and December 12, 2017.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the positive side of things, UBTC aims to implement smart contracts, the Lightning Network, and SegWit, all of which lead to faster and cheaper transactions and better scalability. Ultimately, United Bitcoin (UBTC) may be one of the most important bitcoin hard forks in history. Or, it could be a total non-event. However, it has more industry support (like from Jeff Garzik) than some of the scammy bitcoin hard forks out there – and that means you should pay attention. Stay tuned for more information about United Bitcoin as the project moves forward.","twitter_screen_name":"United_Bitcoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1362/small/united-bitcoin.png?1548759447","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"26.073","developer_score":"46.123","community_score":"7.148","liquidity_score":"42.717","public_interest_score":"42.115","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

The use of decentralized exchanges can also democratize mineral investment methods, allowing both parties to trade without the need for third parties. Less management and low cost.\r\n\r\nSettlement and final accounts: Manage the settlement and final accounts of funds through the MNL system, and use the MNL distributed ledger system to reduce costs, which indicates that the mining industry financing can be accelerated through MNL on a global scale.\r\n\r\nCross-border transactions: About 2 billion people worldwide do not have bank accounts. In many cities in developing countries, the number of Western Union remittance branches exceeds the sum of all international banks. Remittances to different countries are a complex and expensive task for simple mineral trading. Paying for MNLC through peer-to-peer makes this process a breeze.\r\n\r\nMining Assets Determination: Mining asset recognition is a prerequisite for owners to develop their minerals, and currently about 70% of the world's population does not have access to a formal property rights system. This provides a space for brokers and advocates to join the government. Corruption and high costs are particularly prevalent in developing countries.

Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of “on-demand” services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides. \r\n\r\nTwo different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power, which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.\r\n\r\n● The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users – where customers create reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit’s incentive model.\r\n\r\n● The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system, Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized. \r\n\r\n● In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user’s viewing space, (ii) the right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information. \r\n\r\nAs such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry’s ecosystem by redistributing ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.","twitter_screen_name":"cosmochain","facebook_username":"cosmochain","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5252/small/cosmo-coin.png?1547040742","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"31.297","developer_score":"12.275","community_score":"16.135","liquidity_score":"39.637","public_interest_score":"35.868","total_supply":"1023000000","circulating_supply":"478300584.9","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.\r\n\r\nZcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-zcash/\">CoinBureau</a> for guide on What is ZCash.","twitter_screen_name":"zcashco","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zec","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/486/small/circle-zcash-color.png?1547034197","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1477612800000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"65.226","developer_score":"84.443","community_score":"41.97","liquidity_score":"70.986","public_interest_score":"37.557","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"6917556.25","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

By laying out the fundamental blockchain infrastructure, Aelf enables businesses to focus on building up their own dapps on their own chains with minimum effort. Acting as the master key, Aelf unlocks the potential for inter-business communication and collaboration using cross-chain efficiency. Incorporating modern technologies such as cloud nodes and parallel processing, Aelf is the blockchain system that achieves secure transactions at commercial scale.\r\n\r\nAelf is one of the cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts following its massive commercial adoption initiative. The coin seems to be leading on the technology front with higher blockchain efficiency, which is why it's also anticipated to be the Linux of Blockchains. aelf is an operating system for blockchains which can be customized by their respective users. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol ELF, with a total supply of 250 million ELF. It was launched on 21 December, 2017 on multiple exchanges in China without any ICO and instead got private investors on board. This ensured better compliance as KYC was done for all investors with most of them being accredited, with a good track record in token investment.\r\n\r\nAelf was developed by Ma Haobao, who is also the CEO of Hoopox. The team is backed by a strong advisory board which includes Michael Arrington (CEO of TechCrunch and founding partner of FGB Capital). The team says it is working on unleashing the blockchain’s potential into mass applications and industries. aelf is now working with Innovation Alliance for increasing the acceptability of blockchain technology which will ultimately increase adoption of aelf’s blockchain. The team is focussed to develop aelf to improve other chains in the ecosystem by providing a template and infrastructure for interaction between the sidechains.\r\n\r\nAelf also has a rewards system – Candy. With the Candy rewards system, you earn points, convertible for ELF, by accomplishing simple, daily tasks. Tasks include liking and replying to aelf tweets, inviting people to the Telegram channel, and other promotional activities. ELF are currently ERC20 tokens. As such, you can store them in any wallet with ERC20 support like MyEtherWallet or Exodus. The Ledger Nano S is also a great option if you’re interested in additional security. \r\n\r\nAelf is a relatively new competitor in the dapp platform race but already has solid support from large investment capital firms.

In a DAG-ledger, each new transaction confirms at least one previous transaction, transactions are represented as “units” in the graph and are not grouped into blocks. This is in contrast to many classical <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>-like blockchain technologies where the structure of the traditional blockchain is the bottleneck that hinders the technology from improving its concurrency. In a DAG-ledger, because there is no block, there is no block size issue. By decoupling branch selection and double-spending detection from transaction verification, and allowing nodes to verify transactions in parallel, in theory, a DAG-ledger can achieve unlimited scalability.\r\n\r\nTrustNote is similar in design to and influenced by DAG-ledgers like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/byteball\">Byteball</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iota\">IOTA</a>. TrustNote takes the commonly used DAG consensus model a bit further and on the top of it, a proof-of-work based consensus scheme (TrustME consensus) is proposed to encourage fair and trustable witness node selection through mining. Most of today’s DAG-ledgers have no incentives like mining. Without proof-of-work based incentives, it’s much harder to achieve decentralized consensus and often weakening the consensus on which it is based. Inspired by DASH’s two-tier network architecture, TrustNote is trying to combine proof-of-work consensus and DAG ledger structure all together, building a more scalable and more secured distributed ledger system.\r\n\r\nTrustNote’s crypto-currency is called “TTT”, TTT will be used in transactions and as mining rewards. TTT’s unit is called “Note”, often specified in Mega Notes (\"MN\"). A fixed supply of one billion (1,000,000,000) MNs will be distributed and no ICO is planned\r\n\r\nTrustNote’s main chain is expected to support mining by Q3 2019, while users can download the mining client and apply to become a super node, super nodes can become miners by participating the TrustME consensus and then get rewarded by issuing valid attestor units. Initiate transactions or issue tokens on TrustNote’s main chain will cost you some TTT Notes. You can buy TTT Notes from some of the cryptocurrency exchanges. TTT is now tradable with BTC and ETH on Bit-Z exchange since April 26, 2018. There are some other exchanges such as a.mom also listed TTT as well. More to come and we will keep you informed here. For those who like to do some test, you can get TTT Test Notes for free. TTT Test Notes can be used to issue tokens and pay for the transaction fees on TrustNote's testnet, however, it doesn’t work on the main chain.\r\n\r\nTrustNote is largely based on Byteball’s source code but also inspired by many other open source projects such as Bitcoin, DASH, IOTA, and Hyperledger Fabric.","twitter_screen_name":"TrustNote","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"3116483","subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4176/small/trustnote-logo.png?1547039447","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"11.715","developer_score":"33.588","community_score":"1.998","liquidity_score":"3.625","public_interest_score":"20.938","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It’s essentially the blockchain version of Venmo, Facebook Money, or Snapchat's Snapcash, all of which allow you to easily transfer money to friends and family via their respective social media platforms. However, unlike these major social media networks that require you to use their native platform to send and receive money, Reddcoin allows you to seamlessly integrate its payment features on multiple platforms like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and more. Reddcoin is a social cryptocurrency that can be integrated with many different social media platforms for sending/receiving money with zero fees.\r\n\r\nIt’s a peer-to-peer open-source cryptocurrency forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>. It dedicates much of its efforts to facilitate the “tipping” of small amounts of RDD on social networks, done in a similar fashion to “liking” a post on FB. The PoSV algorithm is a new take on PoS which encourages both ownership (stake) and activity (velocity). Its tipping system has already been enabled on Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, and Justin.TV. Reddcoin was created on January 20, 2014, as a PoW cryptocurrency.  On February 2, 2014, after raising $100,000 through their Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO), Reddcoin was released to the public. On April 29, 2014, they announced that Reddcoin would transition from PoW to PoSV.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Reddcoin made an official announcement listing their team members, including developers John Nash and Leonard Simonse. In subsequent Tweets, they’ve publicly announced the additions of developers such as Bradley Ploof and James Tweeg. They’ve been active in updating the community via Twitter, but if you’d like to keep informed directly on the teams project progress, check out their GitHub or Trello (which includes the project roadmap).","twitter_screen_name":"reddcoin","facebook_username":"reddcoin","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":"423597","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/40/small/reddcoin.png?1547033681","country_origin":"","genesis_date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1390694400000"}},"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"51.789","developer_score":"63.698","community_score":"55.448","liquidity_score":"23.97","public_interest_score":"34.562","total_supply":null,"circulating_supply":"29258953891.0065","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs.

The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.

Businesses, enterprises, and innovators can avoid costly and failure prone centralized architecture by utilizing an all-in-one sustainable platform which provides augmented secured services, content delivery, storage, and media streaming.\r\n\r\nThe ProximaX protocol aims to offer DApp developers cost-efficient fault tolerant, multilayer, P2P cloud services including, but not limited to, blockchain-powered P2P storage and bandwidth. A fault-tolerant system is designed to ensure a system remains fully functional even when part of it is ‘down’ or unavailable. ProximaX will build a P2P cloud storage architecture with fault tolerance and a distributed database by removing the central entity and connecting all the servers (or nodes) in a mesh configuration. Failure of any single component of the mesh will have minimal effect upon the overall performance of the system. ProximaX protocol will ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data passing through a myriad of nodes. The use of distributed databases (DHT) ensures consistency and integrity throughout the network.\r\n\r\nProximaX distributed file management system (DFMS) interfaces with NEM blockchain and works in four scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Public chain\r\n2. ProximaX Private DFMS with NEM Public Chain\r\n3. ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Private Chain\r\n4.

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.","twitter_screen_name":"Tether_to","facebook_username":"tether.to","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/tether.png?1547034089","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"44.984","developer_score":"0","community_score":"16.514","liquidity_score":"101.11","public_interest_score":"37.25","total_supply":"3492446801","circulating_supply":"3561089500.336565","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

These currencies are not fiat-based therefore empowering individuals to conduct trade without unnecessary government oversight.\r\n\r\nQuaestor Solutions strives to improve the lifestyle of every associate. To this end, our program facilitates and encourages the use of cryptocurrencies in every-day life. We introduce the Quaestor Coin which is available to associates and MasterNode owners, as well for you who believe in our concept.\r\n\r\nTo help as many people as possible, we have introduced a great concept, where everybody can be invited to the complete setup, for a small fee, and participate in webinars and seminars weekly to help even the most novice beginner to understand the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, and methods to employ its use in our everyday lives. Here you also will learn how to analyze MasterNodes and Trading-Bot features.\r\n\r\nMasterNodes are the backbones of cryptocurrencies. They are computers (servers) that form a network. MasterNodes are utilized to complete unique functions in ways ordinary nodes (miners) can’t. They can be used for features like direct send, instant transactions or private transactions. They maintain the currency’s blockchain.\r\n\r\nOwning a MasterNode can be cost prohibitive. Buying servers, internet services, and the electricity that powers them can be costly. But if you rent space on an available server, you lower your costs substantially. However, you still need to run programs and understand Linux, a computer operating system, which is foreign to most home computer users. Fortunately, for the service they provide, MasterNode owners are rewarded handsomely.\r\n\r\nQuaestor Solutions has developed a system that makes MasterNode ownership affordable and convenient. You don’t need to find hosting, understand Linux or pay for utilities. The Quaestor “Click It” System was born.","twitter_screen_name":"quaestorcoin","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"subreddit_url":null,"image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7575/small/nxrUGKND_400x400.jpg?1548516671","country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"ico_data":false,"coingecko_score":"3.791","developer_score":"0","community_score":"4.509","liquidity_score":"1","public_interest_score":"24.639","total_supply":"20000000","circulating_supply":"0","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Starcro is accessible to any invited, anywhere, anytime, with any type of device and network. \r\n\r\nStarcro is run by an unique consensus algorithm called PoX(Proof of eXpansion). PoX is developed to compensate the shortcomings of PoW and PoS which causes centralization in the decentralized system by hashpower competition or stake monopolization. PoX is a truly distributed, decentralized, and eco-friendly system, since any expensive mining hardware is not needed, and the rewards are given according to the node distribution.\r\n\r\nThrough the PoX system, Starcro presents a human-oriented crypto economy. For example, nodes are regarded as a critical component of a blockchain’s infrastructure; however, since the term ‘node’ means a device(computer, mobile) on a blockchain network, we use a term ‘provers’ - people who run the Starcro network.\r\n\r\n For the first time ever in the blockchain industry, Starcro implemented a user identity verification system, and based on the PoX algorithm, participants get rewards every first day of the month.  Each participant gets different amount of rewards, and the reward amount increases as the number of the relationship between referrer and referred increases. \r\n\r\nThe concept of mining difficulty also exists on Starcro.
